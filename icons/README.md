The runtime form of the editor's icons. `art/editor-icons/` is where they are
*drawn* and reviewed; this is what the engine *loads*.

**This directory is data. No code here.** What the engine has to do with it is
specified below so it can be built without reading the art brief.

## Where it goes at build time

Same shape as the two content sources that already exist:

```
i18n/en.json    ->  content/i18n/en.json          engine/app/CMakeLists.txt:112
shaders/        ->  content/shaders/              cmake/engine_shaders.cmake
icons/          ->  content/icons/                to be added
```

`platform::paths().contentDir` is `executableDir/content`, so a theme resolves
to `content/icons/<themeId>/theme.json`. A plain recursive copy is enough —
these are finished PNGs and nothing needs compiling.

**Do not route these through `assetc`.** It sends every image to basisu for
KTX2/UASTC with generated mips, which is right for a world texture and wrong
here: block compression smears small alpha shapes, and a 16-pixel icon is
nothing but small alpha shapes. Copy them.

## A theme

A theme is any directory containing a `theme.json`:

```json
{
  "id": "default",
  "name": "Ludwerk Default",
  "version": 1,
  "size": 256,
  "tintable": true,
  "fallback": "class.Instance",
  "icons": {
    "class.Part": "class/Part.png",
    "content.Folder": "class/Folder.png",
    "action.List": "class/UIListLayout.png"
  }
}
```

| Field | |
|---|---|
| `id` | the directory name, and how a project or plugin names this theme |
| `size` | the square edge of every PNG in it. All 256 here |
| `tintable` | the images are **masks**: white everywhere, meaning in the alpha. Multiply by a theme colour at draw time |
| `fallback` | the id to draw when a lookup misses. Must exist |
| `icons` | logical id to path, relative to the theme directory |

**Paths repeat on purpose.** Twelve ids point at another id's file — a browser
`Folder` and a tree `Folder` are one drawing, and a `.glb` in the content folder
is what a `MeshPart` points at. Two names for one file, never two files that are
the same icon and drift apart the first time one is touched.

## Colour: `palette`, `roles`, and the one rule that governs them

Every icon is tinted, and **the tint says what KIND of thing it is, never which
thing.** The shape carries the identity; the colour only makes a long tree
scannable. That distinction is not decorative — it is the same rule that decided
the engine's own mark, and it is what makes everything below safe.

```json
"defaultRole": "neutral",
"palette": { "spatial": { "light": "#184E88", "dark": "#A7CAEF" }, ... },
"roles":   { "class.Part": "spatial", "action.Delete": "danger", ... }
```

`roles` names an id's palette key. **An id absent from `roles` takes
`defaultRole`** — thirty of the seventy-eight are, and they are the toolbar
verbs, which are chrome. Four verbs are not: `Play`, `Pause`, `Stop`, `Delete`.
A toolbar of ten colours is a fruit salad; a toolbar where the destructive one is
red is a tool.

**Ten categories, not seventy-eight colours.** Seventy-eight is noise. Ten is
something a person learns in a day and then reads without looking, and it is what
every editor that does this well does.

### Two values per role, and why it is not two decisions

`light` and `dark` are the value on a light panel and on a dark one. A single
colour cannot serve both: clearing 3:1 against a near-white panel wants luminance
under 0.175 and clearing it against the dark panel wants over 0.11, and
everything inside that band is muddy.

They are **solved from one hue**, not picked twice. That is what stops them
drifting — nobody chooses the second value by eye.

### Every value clears WCAG, and the palette survives colour blindness

The floor anywhere in the palette is **3.88:1**, against the 3:1 WCAG 1.4.11 asks
of a non-text graphic.

More importantly, the roles are separated by **lightness as well as hue**, and
which role gets which lightness was chosen by search rather than by eye — the
objective being to maximise the smallest distance between any two roles across
normal vision and all three dichromacies at once. Hand-ordering it reached a
worst-case separation of 8; the search reaches 28.8.

That matters because **no ten hues stay distinct under deuteranopia**, which
about one man in twelve has. Hue alone would have collapsed `spatial` into `ui`
and `script` into `spatial`. With the lightness ranks, the palette degrades to a
legible greyscale instead of to mush.

**Tinting must be switchable off**, and when it is, every icon takes the panel's
own foreground. The set was drawn and collision-checked in one ink before any
colour existed, so the uncoloured editor is not a degraded one.

### How a plugin recolours things

`palette` and `roles` are both sparse overlays, exactly like `icons`. A plugin
that wants one class in its own colour adds a palette key and points that id at
it:

```json
"palette": { "myCompany.Rig": { "light": "#7A1F5C", "dark": "#E48CC4" } },
"roles":   { "class.CharacterBody": "myCompany.Rig" }
```

No file, no drawing, four lines. And because a role is a *name* rather than a
hex, a plugin that only wants a different green overrides `palette.script` once
and every scripting icon moves together.

## The id namespace

Three groups, and the prefix says which question the icon answers:

| Prefix | What it names | Count |
|---|---|---|
| `class.` | a class the Explorer can show — the name is the class name exactly | 42 |
| `action.` | something a person clicks: toolbar, panel buttons, tree chevrons | 24 |
| `content.` | a `ContentKind` from `app/content_tree.h` | 6 |
| `overlay.` | a badge drawn ON TOP of another icon — see below | 2 |

### `overlay.` — a badge, and it is drawn differently from everything else

An overlay is not an icon in a row. It is a mark in the corner of one, and it is
the only namespace whose ids are **not** drawn on their own.

```json
"overlay": { "scale": 0.40, "haloScale": 1.22, "corner": "bottom-right" }
```

**Two ids, drawn in this order, every time:**

1. `overlay.StampBase` — the badge's outer silhouette, solid, with no interior
   detail — drawn in **the panel's own background colour** at
   `scale * haloScale` of the icon's edge. This punches a clean hole in whatever
   is underneath.
2. `overlay.Stamp` — the same silhouette with the mark cut out — drawn in the
   foreground at `scale`, centred in that hole.

**The knockout is not a refinement, it is what makes the badge exist.** Measured
across the class set at 16 px: **37 of 42 icons already have ink where the badge
goes** — up to 51% under `class.Workspace` and 49% under `class.Folder`. A bare
badge lands on a folder's body and disappears.

**The two files share an outer silhouette exactly** — zero pixels of difference,
because the mark is the base with a hole punched in it rather than a second
drawing of the same shape. One pixel of disagreement shows as a rim on one side.
They are produced by a script for that reason: it is a precision requirement, and
an image model cannot meet one.

**The silhouette is a circle, and that is the load-bearing choice.** Most of the
class set is rectangular — `Frame`, `TextButton`, `ScreenGui`, `Part`, `Model`,
`UICorner`. A rounded-square badge in the corner of a rounded rectangle joins the
family: composited over `class.Folder` it reads as a notch bitten out of the
corner rather than as a mark placed on top. A circle never does that on any icon
at any size. **At 7 px the hole inside is two pixels and its shape does not
survive — only the outline does**, which is why the outline is the decision.

`scale` was chosen by sweeping 0.34 to 0.52 composited over the real icons at
16 px: below 0.40 the hole closes, above it the badge starts eating the subject.

An overlay takes `defaultRole` like anything else, so it inherits the panel's
foreground. If a badge ever needs to be told apart from the icon it sits on,
give it its own palette role — do not tint it by the subject's role, because a
badge means the same thing everywhere.

`class.` ids are the generated class names, so a lookup is mechanical:
`"class." + instance.className`. Likewise `content.` maps straight off the
`ContentKind` enum.

## How a lookup resolves — and this is what makes plugins work

In order, first hit wins:

1. **A project override** — `<project>/.engine/icons/<id>.png`. One file, no
   manifest. This is how somebody replaces exactly one icon without shipping a
   theme.
2. **Plugin themes**, in load order. A plugin ships a directory with a
   `theme.json` and **only the ids it overrides** — a partial theme is legal and
   is the normal case.
3. **The active theme**, if a project names one.
4. **`default`**, which is complete by construction.
5. **The `fallback` id** of whichever theme was consulted last.

The rule that makes this cheap: **a theme does not have to be complete.** Only
`default` does. Everything else is a sparse overlay, so overriding one icon
costs one file and four lines of JSON, and a theme cannot break the editor by
forgetting an id.

Resolution belongs in one function that takes an id and returns a texture. If
that function is the only thing that knows about themes, adding a plugin source
later is adding a case to a list rather than touching every call site.

## What the loader has to do

**Downscale once, at load, and cache.** These are 256 px and the Explorer draws
at 16, 20, 24 and 32. Resampling per frame is waste; resampling with a poor
filter is a smudge. Box or Lanczos to the sizes actually used, into an atlas.

**One atlas, not seventy textures.** Sixty-seven files at four sizes is a lot of
binds for a tree that redraws every frame. Pack them; ImGui takes a native
texture handle and UVs (`debug_overlay.cpp:724` already draws one).

**Tint at draw time.** RGB is white everywhere and the meaning is in the alpha,
so one file serves both the light and the dark panel. There is no `d_` set and
there must not be one — two drawings of the same icon drift.

**A generated registry is worth it.** This repository already generates C++ from
data (`api/generator/gen_cpp.luau` writes the class descriptors). An icon id
enum generated from `default/theme.json` turns a missing icon into a build error
and a typo into a compile failure, instead of a blank square at runtime. It also
makes the class list and the icon list unable to drift apart silently.

## What is not here yet

**Nothing is missing.** All 78 ids resolve to a master, and no two ids that are
meant to be different icons share a file by hash. The six that were absent while
this file was first written — `Delete`, `Save`, `Open`, `New`, `Rename`,
`Refresh` — are in.

No redraw is outstanding. `action.Rotate` was the last one and it landed
centred, so every id in the theme is the drawing it is meant to be.

**The smallest size any of these is drawn at is the toolbar's**, which is
`GetFrameHeight() - FramePadding.y * 2` in `debug_overlay.cpp` — the font size,
13 px at ImGui's default. That is the number to check a new icon against, not
16: below about 20 px an arrowhead stops being a head on every circular icon in
the set, and what has to survive is the silhouette underneath it.

## Re-baking

Run `python icons/bake.py` from the repository root (or any working directory
with an absolute script path). It delegates to `tools/repo/draw_icons.py`, which
rebuilds the Orbit SVG exports, the 256-pixel runtime masks, and the light/dark
review sheets from shared geometry. Pillow is the only art-tool dependency.

The existing `default/theme.json` is the manifest: the bake preserves its IDs,
aliases, colors and overlay settings. See the
[Orbit specification](../art/editor-icons/orbit/STYLE.md) for the exact prompt,
editing instructions and review sizes. Earlier PNG masters remain historical
references and are no longer bake inputs.
