# The graphics settings family, as a differential (roadmap M8, ADR 0044).
#
# A quality preset that is wired up and does nothing looks exactly like one that
# works: the frame still renders, the flags are still accepted, and the log still
# says which preset is in effect. The only instrument that can tell is one that
# looks at pixels, and the claim it has to make is the OPPOSITE of a golden's --
# two settings must NOT produce the same image.
#
# This is D043's lesson applied before the fact rather than after it. That defect
# shipped an instanced path drawing nothing, and three green instruments agreed
# with the empty frame because none of them compared an image against an image.
#
# Invoked as:
#   cmake -DHOST=<engine-host> -DIMGCMP=<imgcmp> -DSCRIPT=<project>
