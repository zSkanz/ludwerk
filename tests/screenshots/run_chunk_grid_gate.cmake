# Is there a picture of the chunk state at all?
#
# **E5 owed this screenshot and could not take it.** The gate row is "a
# screenshot of the chunk-state overlay is attached to the gate record", and the
# overlay it meant was an ImGui panel -- which cannot render headlessly, so the
# row sat PENDING from the day the milestone closed. Drawing the grid through
# `DebugDraw` puts it in the ordinary renderer, where `--headless --screenshot`
# already reaches: the version that is better for a person looking at a world is
# also the version a gate can capture, which is why the grid exists in the world
# rather than as a way to photograph a panel.
#
# A differential, and its claim is the opposite of a golden's: the same frame
# with the grid on and with it off must NOT be the same image. The same shape
# `run_local_shadow_gate` uses, and for the reason D043 records -- that defect
# shipped an instanced path drawing nothing, and three green instruments agreed
# with the empty frame because none of them compared an image against an image.
#
# The scene's own script opens `DebugService:ShowPanel("Streaming")` on its
# second tick, so the frame number selects which picture:
#
#   `--frames=1`  no grid: the world alone, and the reference
#   `--frames=3`  the grid over it
#
# Nothing else in the scene moves, so a difference can only be the grid.
