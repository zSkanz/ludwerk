# Do `SpotLight.Shadows` and `PointLight.Shadows` change the picture?
#
# **The only question worth asking about them**, and the one nothing could ask
# for three milestones. Both properties were stored, plumbed all the way to
# `RenderLight::shadows` and read by no pass, and every instrument short of
# comparing two images would have passed throughout: the frame rendered, the
# property read back what was written, the light still lit.
#
# So this is a differential and its claim is the opposite of a golden's -- two
# runs must NOT produce the same image. The same shape `run_settings_differential`
# uses, and for the same reason D043 records: that defect shipped an instanced
# path drawing nothing, and three green instruments agreed with the empty frame
# because none of them compared an image against an image.
#
# The scene renders one case per frame number: 1 is the spot casting, 2 is the
# point casting, 3 is neither. Its sun is switched off entirely, so a difference
# between any two of them cannot be the cascades.
#
# Invoked as:
#   cmake -DHOST=<engine-host> -DIMGCMP=<imgcmp> -DSCRIPT=<project>
#         -DOUTPUT=<dir> -P run_local_shadow_gate.cmake
