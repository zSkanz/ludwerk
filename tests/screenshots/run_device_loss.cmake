# ADR 0091: the engine survives a lost graphics device -- a driver reset, which
# is what a surface shader that runs too long causes -- and does not draw the
# surface that was on screen again until it changes.
#
# The loss is simulated (`--simulate-device-loss`), the same path a real one
# takes from the RHI up: every call after it is dropped, the frame loop ends,
# and the process exits with its own code instead of dying inside the driver.
# A real reset was reproduced by hand, and the crash it caused is what this
# guards (the SDL patch 0002 and `IDevice::lost`).
#
#     cmake -DHOST=... -DSCENE=<a project with a surface> -DOUTPUT=<dir> -P ...
