"""Generates tests/screenshots/specular/content/models/ball.gltf.

Checked in as the .gltf it produces rather than run at build time, for the same
reason `examples/04-obby/tools/make_waver.py` is: a text glTF diffs line by line,
and a generator in the build would make test content depend on Python.

**A polished metal sphere is the smallest thing that can show specular
aliasing.** The normal turns through a full hemisphere across the silhouette, so
at any size the outer ring of pixels covers a large slice of directions -- and a
GGX lobe at roughness 0.1 is narrower than that slice long before the sphere
gets small. That mismatch is the whole phenomenon: the highlight has nowhere
stable to sit, and a camera moving a fraction of a pixel makes it crawl.

A UV sphere, and the ring/segment counts are chosen so that geometry is NOT the
thing under test: at 32 by 48 the facets are far below a pixel at every distance
this scene places a ball at, so a shimmer in the render is the shading's and not
the tessellation's.
