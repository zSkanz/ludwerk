# Generates an example's world if it is not there (D046).
#
# **Two gates depended on an artifact that nothing produced.** The streamed
# examples' chunk SOURCES are generated and gitignored, deliberately -- 4.8 MB
# of JSON from a hundred committed lines, and the roadmap asks for no giant
# binary assets in the repository. `run.bat` regenerates them for a human. What
# nothing did was regenerate them for a GATE, so `streaming_soak` and
# `asset_determinism` passed on this machine because the world happened to be
# there from a hand-run, and on a fresh clone they would have compiled an empty
# directory. Neither had ever run in CI to say so.
#
# Included by the gate drivers rather than duplicated in them, and it is the
# same step `run.bat` performs, for the same reason and in the same order.
#
# Expects: GENERATOR (the .luau file), REPO (the repository root -- the
# generator writes to a path relative to it), and WORLD (the path whose absence
# means "generate").
#
# **`WORLD` is a path and not necessarily a directory** (ADR 0053). A generator
# that writes chunk sources produces a folder; one that writes a scene the engine
# partitions at play produces a file, and the flagship's moved from the first to
# the second. `EXISTS` answers for both, which is why this file did not have to
# learn the difference.
