# M7's gate, as two steps: build the example's assets, then fly over them.
#
# Two steps rather than one because the chunk SOURCES are in the repository and
# the compiled `.lchunk` payloads are not -- `.engine/` is ignored, deliberately,
# since a build output in git is a merge conflict waiting to be resolved by
# guessing. So a fresh clone has a world to build and no world to stream, and a
# gate that assumed otherwise would pass locally and fail in CI.
#
# Which also makes this the asset-build determinism check's other half: the pack
# is compiled here from the same sources on every tier, and `assetc` is the tool
# whose output the determinism test hashes.
