# M7's gate: "asset build determinism check in CI".
#
# **Two PROCESSES, not two calls**, and that is the whole reason this exists
# beside the in-process double-build in `engine_assetc_tests`. An in-process pair
# shares an address space, a heap layout, a locale and an environment, so it
# cannot see the failures that actually make a content build non-reproducible:
# a hash seeded from an address, a container iterated in allocation order, a
# timestamp, a path that leaked into an output, an environment variable read
# once. Two runs of the same binary can.
#
# Every output is compared, not just the pack. A manifest that matched while the
# pack differed would be a cache that hands back the wrong bytes under the right
# name -- which is the failure mode the whole content-addressing design exists to
# make impossible, and therefore the one worth checking.
