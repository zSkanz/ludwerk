# This is the *blocking* render-regression gate (docs/architecture.md §9). It
# needs no GPU and no driver, which is the whole point: a graphics vendor's
# update must not be able to turn the merge queue red. Real-image comparison is
# the agent's own verification tool and, from M4, a nightly non-blocking job.
