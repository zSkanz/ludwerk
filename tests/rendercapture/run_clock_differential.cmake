# The differential render gate (roadmap M4.5): render one scene at two
# `ClockTime` values and require the two command streams to DIFFER.
#
# This is not a golden and deliberately not one. A golden compares a recording
# against a previous recording, so it certifies whatever was true when it was
# taken -- and for the whole of M4 what was true was that `Lighting` never
# reached the renderer. Six goldens, three camera angles, two lighting states,
# all green, all describing a sun pinned straight up.
#
# A differential compares two runs of the SAME build against each other. There is
# no recording to re-record, so there is nothing to accidentally bless.
#
# Two claims, and both matter:
#
#   1. The two frames differ. If `Lighting` stops reaching the frame, they do
#      not, and this goes red.
#   2. The two frames have the same number of commands. What changes with the
#      clock is the *content* of a frame, not its shape -- a scene that grew a
#      draw would satisfy claim 1 for the wrong reason, which is precisely how a
#      check ends up passing while proving nothing.
