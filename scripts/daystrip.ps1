# Renders the M4.5 deliverable as one image: `tests/screenshots/daystrip`, a
# fixed camera, one frame per three hours of the day, laid side by side.
#
# The point is a claim no single screenshot can carry -- that the sun crosses the
# sky, that shadows lengthen towards evening, and that `Transparency` passes
# through every value rather than switching. A fixed camera is what makes the
# strip readable: with an orbit in it, nobody can say which variable moved the
# shadow.
#
# Every frame comes from a separate host run. `ClockTime` in that scene is a
# function of the tick count divided by the hold, so `--frames=N` selects the
# hour and gives the automatic exposure time to settle on it; the host
# writes its screenshot at exit.

#   scripts/daystrip.ps1                       # 8 frames -> docs/images/daystrip.png
#   scripts/daystrip.ps1 -Frames 12 -Width 640 # denser, smaller
#
# Needs a real GPU: it renders through the default backend rather than through
# `--rhi=capture`, because the thing being looked at is pixels.
