# Tier-2 (Linux) build environment, runnable on the dev machine.
#
# The roadmap already anticipates gates running locally rather than on a hosted
# runner ("a scripted local gate ... recorded in the gate log either way"). This
# is that, for the Linux tier: the same distribution `ubuntu-latest` currently
# resolves to, the same compiler, and the dependency list
# `.github/workflows/ci.yml` installs.
#
# **A superset of that list, in two places, and both are deliberate.** This
# image carries `mesa-vulkan-drivers` and `vulkan-tools`, which give the tier a
# software Vulkan device the hosted runner has not got, and `xvfb`, which gives
# it a screen. Together those are what let this tier run the tests that need a
# window and a device -- the editor shell among them -- instead of reporting a
# pass it never earned (S7.8). The direction matters: the image may test MORE
# than CI does, never less, so a gate that is green here and red there is still
# a bug in the change rather than in the image.
#
# It exists so a portability break is found in seconds on the machine that
# caused it, instead of minutes later on metered CI. Keeping the two in step is
# a maintenance cost paid deliberately: when the workflow's package list
# changes, this changes with it, and the comment in ci.yml says so.

    # The two disagree about which headers bring in which: libstdc++ 13 still
    # reaches `<algorithm>` through `<string>` and its neighbours, 14 does not,
    # so a file that used `std::clamp` without naming its header compiled here
    # and stopped CI. Same compiler, same distribution, different library --

    # `linux-clang-asan` preset does not fail at link time, where it would be
    # obvious -- it fails at COMPILE time on Luau's `lmem.cpp`, which includes
    # `<sanitizer/asan_interface.h>` to tell ASan about its own allocator's
    # poisoning. That is a vendored file R13 forbids editing, so the image is
    # the only place this can be fixed.

    # fails here with CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_CLANG_SCAN_DEPS-NOTFOUND while a hosted
    # runner is perfectly happy. The root CMakeLists turns the scan off instead
    # -- nothing here uses modules -- which removes the work rather than
    # installing a tool to do work nobody needs. This image found that.
