# The local gate: everything CI checks that can be checked on this machine.
#
# The roadmap already allows gates to run here rather than on a hosted runner
# ("a scripted local gate ... recorded in the gate log either way"). This is
# that script, and it exists for two reasons that are not the same:
#
#   Cost. This repository is private, so Actions minutes carry the platform
#   multipliers and a full run is expensive. Everything below is free.
#
#   Speed. A missing package in a container is a three-minute discovery here and
#   a ten-minute one there -- and the second kind gets batched, which is how a
#   break survives to the next commit.
#
# What it CANNOT do is macOS. Nothing local can, so Tier-3 stays on CI at the
# milestone gate.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/localgate.ps1              # everything -- what you run before a push
#   scripts/localgate.ps1 -Only docs   # one stage: docs | luau | format | windows | linux | shipping
#   scripts/localgate.ps1 -Only asan   # address and UB sanitizers, opt-in (see below)
#   scripts/localgate.ps1 -Only winprofiles   # the three profiles a Windows release
#                                             # ships, on MSVC, opt-in (see below)
#   scripts/localgate.ps1 -Only lavapipe      # the real-image goldens, on Mesa's
#                                             # software rasterizer, opt-in
#   scripts/localgate.ps1 -Only lavapipe -Record   # ...rewrite those goldens
#   scripts/localgate.ps1 -Only android       # the engine cross-built for Android
#                                             # arm64 with the pinned NDK; part of
#                                             # every run once scripts/install-android.ps1
#                                             # has installed it
#   scripts/localgate.ps1 -SkipLinux   # ONLY when Docker is genuinely unavailable
#   scripts/localgate.ps1 -Only format -Fix   # rewrite the C++ tree instead of checking it
#   scripts/localgate.ps1 -AllowSkips         # ONLY on a machine with no GPU
#   scripts/localgate.ps1 -Only windows -Tests 'render|terrain_far'
#                                             # THE INNER LOOP: build, then only the
#                                             # tests matching the regex (ctest -R);
#                                             # the full run once per push
#   scripts/localgate.ps1 -Serial             # the stages one after another, as
#                                             # before ADR 0148, to read one log
#
# **The full run is three lanes at once** (ADR 0148): the docs lint alone; this
# machine's own build -- luau, then windows, then android, which needs the
# windows stage's tools; and the container's -- format, then linux, then
# shipping, inside Docker's half of the CPUs. Each lane is this script run
# again with `-Stages`, its log kept and printed whole when it ends, and the
# run is as long as its longest lane.
#
# **A skipped test is a failure here.** Six gates in this repository answer
# `ENG_TEST_SKIP` when there is no graphics device, and ctest counts a skip as
# a pass -- so a GPU that stopped coming up would turn all six green with no
# alarm, and the pixel gates, the two-worlds proof and the settings differential
# would all quietly stop meaning anything. This machine has a device; if a test
# skips on it, something is wrong with the machine or with the test. -AllowSkips
# is for a machine that genuinely has no GPU, and typing it is the point:
# accepting the loss should be a decision, not a default.
#
# The Linux stage is about twelve seconds warm and is not redundant with the
# Windows one: Clang diagnoses things MSVC does not, warnings are errors, and it
# has already caught a defect that would otherwise have reached CI. Skipping it
# to go faster is a false economy -- use -Only for that.

# warnings-as-errors is the stricter reader of the `#if`s that only this profile
# takes.
#
# **It builds three profiles, not one** (D057, and `editor` since): `shipping`,
# `player` and `editor` -- the three nothing else here compiles. `player` is
# what `ludwerk build` packages, the Luau compiler ON and the debug overlay OFF,
# a combination no other profile has; `editor` is the reverse pairing and is
# what a released editor archive is built from. Without this each would be a
# shipped artifact no gate ever built, which is the objection that ruled out
# shipping the `shipping` profile in the first place.
#
# This comment said TWO until 2026-08-26, and so did the error message below --
# a stage that names fewer profiles than it builds is one whose failure sends
# somebody looking in two places when the fault is in a third (S8.3).
#
# Cost: `engine_host` alone from each, compiled and linked, and not the tree
# around them. The reasoning is in the script, and the short version is that
# only what ENG_LUAU_COMPILER and ENG_DEBUG_UI gate can rot differently
# here, and all of it is reachable from those executables. A few seconds warm,
# one full Release build of the vendored tree cold.
#
# Last, because it is the stage most likely to be cold, and a run that fails

# **The three profiles a WINDOWS release ships, on the compiler that ships them**

#
# The `shipping` stage above builds `shipping`, `player` and `editor` -- on
# Tier-2, deliberately, because Clang with warnings-as-errors is the stricter
# reader of the `#if`s only those profiles take. What it cannot read is MSVC.
# And MSVC is what the Windows release is compiled with, so the three artifacts
# a person actually downloads were built by no gate on any machine: `ludwerk
# build` packages `win-msvc-player`, a released editor archive is
# `win-msvc-editor`, and neither had ever been compiled outside a release.
#
# The failure that hides here is specific rather than hypothetical. These
# profiles differ from `dev` by what `ENG_LUAU_COMPILER` and `ENG_DEBUG_UI`
# gate, so what rots in them is code inside an `#if` -- and a preprocessor
# branch that one compiler takes and another does not is precisely where the
# two disagree. D056 is this repository's own instance: an unknown number of
# commits where the shipping profile did not compile at all.
#
# Opt-in for the same reason as `asan`: three Release configures and three
# builds of the vendored tree is minutes, not seconds, and the standing gate is
# something a person runs before every push. It belongs before a RELEASE, which
# is where `docs/finish-line.md` S8.6 puts it, and here for the afternoon
# somebody has touched a `#if ENG_DEBUG_UI`.
#
# It runs the same `shipping-build.sh` the Tier-2 stage does, with the three
# preset names passed in -- the script already takes them that way, and one
# implementation of "which profiles and which target" is what CLAUDE.md asks
