# The three profiles nothing else in this repository builds, compiled and
# linked.
#
# `shipping` is here because that is how it came to be broken for an unknown
# length of time (D056): `ENG_LUAU_COMPILER=OFF` and `ENG_DEBUG_UI=OFF` are
# set for it alone, so every `#if` around them is code no other gate ever reads.
#
# **`player` is here for the same reason and it is newer** (D057). It is the
# profile `ludwerk build` packages -- the Luau compiler ON, the debug overlay OFF,
# a combination no other profile has -- so it is a SHIPPED artifact that,
# without this, no gate would ever compile. That was precisely the objection
# that ruled out "just ship the shipping profile": a profile nothing builds is a
# profile nobody knows is broken.
#
# **`editor` is the third, and it is the same argument a third time** (ADR
# 0054). It is what `tools/repo/package.luau` copies into the archive somebody
# downloads: Release, the debug UI ON and the C++ suite OFF, which is again a
# combination no other profile has. Nothing else would ever configure it, so
# without this the thing people install would be the one build nothing checks.
#
# WHAT THIS BUILDS, AND WHY IT IS NOT THE WHOLE TREE.
#
# `engine_host` -- the shipping binary itself, compiled and linked, and nothing
# else. A whole second profile at full breadth is not free: the dev build is
# already ~700 s cold, and the parts this leaves out (the C++ test suite, which
# the shipping profile does not build at all because it drives the engine
# through Luau source; `assetc`, whose assimp dependency is the largest single
# compile in the tree; the shader toolchain) are proved by the dev stage on
# every run and cannot rot differently here -- they compile with the same flags
# in both. What CAN rot differently is exactly what the two profile options
# gate, and all of it is reachable from this one executable. Linking rather
# than compiling only, because half of ADR 0011's claim is a link-time one: a
# shipping binary contains no ImGui because no ImGui target was declared, and a
# call site that survived an `#ifdef` sweep shows up as an unresolved symbol
# rather than as an error in a translation unit.
#
# Warm this is a few seconds. Cold -- the first run, or after a `third_party`
# change -- it is a full Release build of the vendored tree, once.
#
# Tier-2 (Linux/Clang) rather than Tier-1 by default: warnings are errors on
# both, Clang diagnoses more than MSVC, and it is the 1x platform if this is
# ever wired into CI. Override with ENG_SHIPPING_PRESET to check another one.
