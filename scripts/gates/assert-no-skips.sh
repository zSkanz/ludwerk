# A skipped test is a test that did not run, and CTest counts one as a pass.
#
# Six gates in this repository answer `ENG_TEST_SKIP` when there is no
# graphics device, and `editor_shell` answers it when there is no display. On a
# machine that has both, every one of them is supposed to execute -- so a skip
# means the device stopped being found, or a test stopped being able to reach
# it, and the run is green either way. That is the failure this exists for.
#
#   assert-no-skips.sh <ctest-log> [expected-skip ...]
#
# Named skips are ALLOWED and anything else is a failure. Passing no names means
# no skip is acceptable, which is the right setting for a machine with a device.
# The names are matched exactly against CTest's own summary lines.
#
# **An expected skip that did NOT skip is not a failure.** A runner that grows a
# GPU should not need this file edited before it can be green; the list is a
# ceiling on what may skip, not a claim about what will.
