# The screenshot gate skips here rather than failing: a container has no GPU,
# and `engine-host` reports that with its own exit code so CTest can tell the
# difference between "no driver" and "the picture changed". The capture gate
# does run, because it needs no GPU at all -- which is exactly why it, and not
# the image comparison, is the blocking render gate (architecture.md §9).
# `-LE gpu-golden` is what `engine/app/CMakeLists.txt` already says must happen
# to the pixel goldens: they are tied to the GPU that recorded them, and this
# tier is not it. That exclusion was written down and never applied here -- the
# ABSENCE of a Vulkan device was doing the work, so the tests skipped and nobody
# noticed. Installing lavapipe gave the tier a device and turned a skip into a
# red, which is how a comment that had never been executed came to light.
# **Under a virtual display** (S7.8). This tier has a Vulkan device through
# lavapipe and had no screen at all, so every test that opens a window returned
# before it asserted -- and the one test that enters the editor shell reported a
# pass on a machine it had never run on. `xvfb-run -a` picks a free display
# number and tears the server down afterwards; tests that ask for a headless
# platform still get one, because that is a parameter they pass rather than
# something they infer from the environment.
#
# **Skips are asserted here too, and were not.** `localgate.ps1` fails on a
# skipped test and names it -- on the WINDOWS stage only, which is how
# `editor_shell` came to report Skipped on this tier inside a run that printed
# `ok linux`. The check belongs beside the ctest it is about, and in this file
# rather than in the PowerShell so that every caller of this gate gets it.
#
# Nothing is allowed to skip here: this tier has a device through lavapipe and a
# screen through Xvfb, so a skip means one of those stopped being found.
