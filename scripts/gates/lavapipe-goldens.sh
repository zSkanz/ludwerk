# The real-image golden suite, on Mesa's software rasterizer.
#
# **Both `docs/architecture.md` §9 and `docs/roadmap.md` promise this** and
# neither had it: "a small real-image golden suite (lavapipe on Linux,
# WARP/D3D12 on Windows) runs nightly, non-blocking". What existed was one
# recorded PNG -- `tests/screenshots/meshes-lavapipe.png` -- with its own README
# saying nothing compares it, because a golden that tries to span a discrete GPU
# and a software rasterizer is a golden that can no longer see a real change.
#
# The thing that makes a comparison legitimate here is that it does NOT span
# them. lavapipe is bit-identical to itself: the same scene rendered twice in
# this image differs in zero pixels at tolerance zero, which is what a software
# rasterizer with no scheduling nondeterminism should do and what was measured
# before this file was written. So these goldens are compared EXACTLY, and a
# single changed pixel is a real change.
#
#   scripts/gates/lavapipe-goldens.sh            # compare
#   scripts/gates/lavapipe-goldens.sh --record   # rewrite the goldens
#
# **Non-blocking**, which is what both documents say and what the option
# `ENG_LAVAPIPE_GOLDENS` is for: nothing registers these tests unless it is
# asked to. A Mesa upgrade in the base image WILL move every pixel of every one
# of them, and that must not be able to redden a gate somebody runs before a
# push. It runs nightly, and locally through `localgate.ps1 -Only lavapipe`.
