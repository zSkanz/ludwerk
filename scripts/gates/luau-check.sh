# freshness, and module layering (architecture.md §2).
#
# This file is the gate. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs it and so does
# `scripts/localgate.ps1` -- the same script, not a transcription, because a
# transcription drifts until "it passes locally" stops meaning anything.
#
# The first two checks are `ludwerk check` (M3 brief, Decision 7): the CLI is the
# implementation and this calls it, so a developer typing `ludwerk check` in a
# scaffolded project runs what the gate runs. Everything after it is
# repository-specific -- the IDL, its generated outputs, the module layering --
# and has no meaning inside a user's game.
