# Build the documentation site and open it.
#
# The site is a build product rather than a checked-in artifact, so this is how
# a person looks at it: one command, no server, no install. It opens from a
# file:// URL because every path in it is relative -- which is also what lets it
# be served from a subdirectory of a web server without configuration.
#
# `-Out` writes somewhere else; `-NoOpen` builds without opening, which is what
# a script wants.
