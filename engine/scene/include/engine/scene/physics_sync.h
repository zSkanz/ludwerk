// The mirror between the Instance tree and the simulation (architecture.md §2:

//
// **The tree is the authority and the body is a mirror of it.** A `BasePart`
// under `Workspace` has a body; one taken out of the tree loses it. `scene`
// never learns a body's identity beyond an opaque handle and `physics` never
// learns what an Instance is -- the map between them lives here and nowhere
// else, which is why neither module includes the other's vocabulary.
//
// Writes cross in both directions and each direction has exactly one legal
// point in the frame:
//
//   * **Script to physics** is collected while the script runs and applied at
//     the start of the sim tick. A script that sets `CFrame` mid-frame must not
//     teleport a body the solver is in the middle of.
//   * **Physics to script** happens after the step, as a QUIET write with a
//     batched changed set (architecture.md §4). That is the path the
//     10k-parts benchmark measures; any other route would silently forfeit the
//     equality filter that is worth about a third of it.
//
// Nothing here reads a clock. `step` takes the fixed tick and the caller owns
// the accumulator (R10).
