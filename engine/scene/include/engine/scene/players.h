// per replica only, and a replica has its own. A game reads all of them through
// the same two calls -- `NetworkService:GetPlayers()` and
// `player:GetIntent(action)` -- whether or not anybody is networked, which is
// what makes a multiplayer game's code the same code as its solo one.
//
// These helpers are the one place players are made and unmade, so
// `PlayerAdded` and `PlayerRemoving` fire on every path that does either.
