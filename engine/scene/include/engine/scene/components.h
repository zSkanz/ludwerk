// Class-specific state, stored as POD components (architecture.md §4).
//
// Every field here backs a property the IDL declares, and the generated
// accessors are the only things that read or write them. They are plain structs
// with no invariants of their own on purpose: `World::snapshot` is a per-pool
// copy, and a component with a constructor, a pointer or a heap allocation
// would make that a traversal instead (ADR 0016).
//
// A class arrives with the milestone that gives it behaviour, and so does its
// component.
//
// **Why the render module's components live in `scene`'s header (M4).**
// `World` holds one `ComponentPool<T>` member per component type and has no
// extension point for a higher module to add its own. A component is data with
// no invariants, so the alternative -- a type-erased pool registry keyed by type
// id -- would rework the ECS core to buy an indirection on every access, and it
// would buy it for exactly the reason architecture.md §2 rule 3 already
// tolerates: `scene` never *includes* `render`, and it does not here either. It
// stores five more POD structs and interprets none of them.
//
// The cost is that this file grows with every module that owns classes, and the
// day that becomes the problem -- physics at M5 is the next candidate -- the
// type-erased registry is the answer. Recorded so that day is a decision rather
// than a discovery.
//
// M5 came and did not spend it. `RigidBodyComponent` and
// `CharacterBodyComponent` are scene's own, not the physics module's: physics
// sits at L2, BELOW scene, so it could not register a class into the scene
// registry even if it wanted to. What crosses the seam is a body handle held by
// the glue, and neither module holds one of the other's types. The registry is
// still the answer for the day a module ABOVE scene brings a third batch.
