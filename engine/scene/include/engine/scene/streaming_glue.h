// Where a chunk becomes instances (architecture.md §10, "budgeted
// materialization ... through the same reflection path as scripts").
//
// The streaming MANAGER decides which chunks should be resident; this decides
// what "resident" means to the world. The split is what lets the policy be
// tested with three lambdas and no scene, and it is why this file knows about
// chunks and the manager does not know about instances.
//
// **Eviction honours §4.** An instance a script still holds a reference to
// cannot simply be destroyed -- the Luau side would be left with a handle to
// nothing -- so it is reparented to nil and becomes a husk, exactly the
// contract `StreamingService.InstanceStreamedOut` documents. Everything else is
// destroyed outright, because a world that never frees is a world with a
// memory ceiling it cannot meet.
