// Turning an authored world into a streamed one (ADR 0053).
//
// **A person builds in `Workspace` and presses play.** The grid decides WHEN
// something becomes eligible and the `Model` decides WHAT comes with it; this is
// the arithmetic in between, and there is nothing in it for anybody to
// configure. Walk the scene, take each instance's position, divide by the cell
// size, and write what falls where.
//
// ## The one constraint everything else follows from
//
// **It never holds the world it is reading.** Building every instance in order
// to decide which ones to hold is the exact cost streaming exists to avoid, so
// this reads the scene as TEXT and builds ONE authored node at a time into a
// scratch world -- long enough to ask what that node became, and no longer.
// The peak is a node and its direct children, or one stamp; it is never a
// function of how many instances the scene has.
//
// Building the node rather than interpreting its JSON is what makes the answer
// exact. A scene node's meaning is `readScene`'s to define -- which properties
// override which, what an enum name resolves to, what a stamp expands into --
// and a second reading of it here would be a second definition that disagrees
// the first time either moves. So the node is built by `readSceneNode` and read
// back out of the components, and the world a partition produces is the world
// loading the scene would have produced.
//
// ## What leaves and what stays
//
// Conservative by construction, and counted rather than assumed. An instance
// leaves the scene only when the cell format can express it whole, nothing else
// in the scene points at it, and it carries no descendant a record cannot say.
// Everything else stays authored, and the report says how much of each. A world
// that streams half a weld is worse than a world that streams less.
