// The outline of a tilemap's solid tiles (the 2D layer, post-v1 phase 3).

// **A floor of tiles collides as one line, not as a row of boxes.** A box per
// tile -- or per run of tiles -- leaves seams, and a character sliding along
// a floor or a wall catches on the corner of the next box: the "ghost
// collision" every 2D engine has had to solve. The answer is the outline:
// every edge between a solid cell and an empty one, joined into closed loops
// around each solid region, straight runs merged into single segments.
