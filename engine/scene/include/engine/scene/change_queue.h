// The facts `scene` produces and `script` turns into signal fires
// (api-design.md §3.1, and the seam described in the M2 brief's Decision 3).
//
// This is the whole of the scene↔script contract for events, and its shape is
// the point: every entry is POD. Signal *arguments* can be arbitrary Luau
// values and connections hold Luau functions, so if `scene` owned the signal
// queue it would hold references into the VM -- and L3 would depend on L5
// (architecture.md §2 rule 2), while the ECS would stop being snapshottable.
//
// So the queue is split by what it carries. `scene` enqueues facts that mean
// something in a headless world with no VM at all; `script` consumes them,
// resolves connections, and runs handlers. `Signal.new()` fires, which do carry
// Luau values, live entirely on the `script` side of the same drain.
