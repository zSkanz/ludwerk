// The typed value that crosses the reflection boundary (architecture.md §4).
//
// Property reads and writes, attribute storage, and the arguments of an
// engine-raised change all move through this type. It is deliberately a closed
// set: the API schema decides what a property may hold (api-design.md §2.2's
// attribute domain is the same list), so a value that is not in this union is a
// value the public surface has no way to produce.
//
// It carries no Luau types and never will. `scene` is L3 and the VM is L5
// (architecture.md §2 rule 2); the conversion between a `Value` and a Luau
// value happens in `script`, which is the only module allowed to know both.
