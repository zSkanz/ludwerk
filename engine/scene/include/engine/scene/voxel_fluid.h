// Fluids in the block world (V1): water that finds its level.
//
// **The rules are the ones block games settled on**, because players already
// know them and they are cheap:
//
// - A block of a fluid type placed as itself is a SOURCE, and stays.
// - Fluid flows DOWN first: the block under any fluid fills, falling, and a
//   falling block is full.
// - A fluid that cannot fall spreads SIDEWAYS, one level weaker per block, up to
//   its type's reach. Only a fluid standing on something spreads; one over air
//   pours instead.
// - A flowing block that nothing feeds any more drains away, one step at a time,
//   back towards whatever still does.
//
// **Stepped on the simulation clock, and only where something changed.** A
// world full of still lakes costs nothing: a block is looked at only when it,
// or a neighbour, was changed -- by a script, by the editor, or by the step
// before. Each fluid type has its own pace, in ticks per step.
//
// **Deterministic (R10).** The blocks due are visited in position order, every
// new state is decided from the grid as it stood before the step, and then all
// of them are written: no block sees a neighbour's half-finished step, and the
// same world and the same tick make the same water on every machine.
