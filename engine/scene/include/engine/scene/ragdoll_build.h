// Turning a rig into a ragdoll: the parts, the bones and the joints that hold
// them (E9 step 13).
//
// **A ragdoll is instances, not a hidden body list.** `Ragdoll` owns nothing --
// the class doc says so and the mirror rule requires it -- so building one means
// creating real `Part`s, real `Bone`s and real constraints under it, every one of
// them a thing you can select, move and delete. What this function does is the
// arithmetic nobody wants to do by hand: where each limb goes, how long it is,
// which way it points, and which joint it stands for.
//
// **Why it is a function in `scene` rather than a method in the binding.** The
// only part of it that can be wrong is geometric -- a capsule whose length came
// out of the wrong pair of joints, a frame whose Y does not run down the bone --
// and that is a thing a test can assert with an invented rig and no VM at all.
// `Ragdoll:Build` is thirty lines on top of this that read a Luau table.
//
// **Determinism (R10).** Limbs are created in the profile's own order, and the
// profile is an ordered list for exactly that reason: a map would leave creation
// order to whatever the table iterated in, and creation order is what instance
// ids are. Every id this produces is therefore a function of the profile and the
// rig, which is what makes a ragdoll replayable.
