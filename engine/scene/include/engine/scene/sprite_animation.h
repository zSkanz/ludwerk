// `SpriteAnimator`'s step (ADR 0102): a sprite sheet played on the simulation
// clock.
//
// **It writes through the world's own verb**, `World::setProperty`, the way a
// tween does: the frame it lands on is its parent's `ImageRectOffset` and
// `ImageRectSize`, and a write the world did not see would be one the undo, the
// wire and a `Changed` listener all miss. Only a rectangle that actually moved
// is written, so a sprite held on one frame costs no change per tick.
