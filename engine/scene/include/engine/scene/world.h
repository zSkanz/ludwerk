    // explains the generation bookkeeping that costs).
    //
    // Call it at a frame boundary with no drain in flight, the same safe point
    // `ComponentPool::compact` asks for. The change queue is CLEARED rather
    // than restored: its entries are facts about a world that no longer exists,
    // and their only consumer is the VM the caller is about to rebuild.
    //
    // **What a restore cannot put back, and what the caller therefore owes.**
    //
    //   * **The Luau VM.** Script variables, connections, coroutines and the
    //     task scheduler's timers are not this module's state and are not in
    //     the snapshot -- ADR 0016 names Luau-state restoration an explicit
    //     non-goal of v1, and `change_queue.h` explains why `scene` holds no
    //     reference into the VM to restore in the first place. The caller
    //     rebuilds the runtime. `InstanceRecord::subscribedProperties` comes
    //     back as it was at snapshot time and the rebuilt VM re-subscribes what
    //     it actually connects; a bit left set for a connection that no longer
    //     exists costs an enqueue nobody consumes, which is why the mask is
    //     restored rather than cleared.
    //   * **The physics mirror.** `PhysicsSync` keeps a body per instance slot
    //     and a character per id, and the backend behind it holds contacts,
    //     velocities and sleep state. The solver CAN be restored now (ADR
    //     0101), but only into the same bodies, and a world snapshot brings
    //     back a different set: the caller destroys the mirror and builds a
    //     new one over the restored tree.
    //   * **Everything else derived and keyed by instance.**
    //     `render::AnimationSystem` (a track per player, a pose per mesh part),
    //     `render::TransformHistory` (last frame's transform, which motion
    //     vectors read), the audio mixer's voices and the UI's layout cache are
    //     all rebuilt from the tree rather than restored. Each already retires
    //     what stops resolving; what a restore adds is instances that REAPPEAR,
    //     which nothing retires. Safe order: restore, then rebuild.
    //   * **The atom table.** Names interned during the play session stay
    //     interned, because the table is shared and append-only. An atom's
    //     number is never observable -- the world hash hashes text for exactly
    //     this reason -- so a table that grew is a few bytes and not a
