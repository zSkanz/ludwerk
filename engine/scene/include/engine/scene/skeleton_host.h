// split is not an accident -- `AnimationSystem::sample` runs at `PreAnimation`
// (architecture.md §3, step 5b) while the joint array it fills lives in
// `render::Pose`, because a palette is a thing a vertex shader consumes.
//
// `AnimationHost` deliberately names no joint: it is about tracks, clips and
// weights, and a caller of it never asks where an elbow is. This is the second,
// narrower seam for the callers that do -- a socket welded to a hand, a ragdoll
// writing a simulated limb back into a pose, an inverse-kinematic solver
// bending an arm. It is the third instance of a pattern `IPhysics3D*` and
// `AnimationHost*` already established: an interface in `scene`, an
// implementation in the module that owns the data, and `app` holding the wire.
//
// **A joint is named by its mesh and its index**, never by a pointer into the
// rig. The rig is reloaded when its file changes, and an index survives that
// where a pointer does not.
