// The mirror between the 2D instances and the 2D simulation (the 2D layer,
// post-v1 phase 3, docs/briefs/p3-2d-kickoff.md).
//
// **`PhysicsSync`'s contract, on the plane.** The tree is the authority and the
// bodies mirror it: a `Part2D` under `Workspace` has a body, a `Tilemap2D` has
// its solid tiles' outline, and one taken out of the tree loses them. A script's
// writes are applied at the start of the tick; the solver's answers are written
// back after it, quietly, straight into the component; what began and stopped
// touching becomes `Touched` and `TouchEnded`, both ways, deferred.
//
// It is a second mirror and not a mode of the first because the two share no
// state: a 3D body and a 2D body never touch. A world may hold both kinds, and
// each is stepped by its own library on the same fixed tick.
//
// A `Constraint2D` is a joint between two of the bodies (ADR 0102), built
// after them and rebuilt whenever either is -- a body rebuilt for a change of
// shape takes its joints with it -- or whenever the joint's own description
// changes. Nothing is adjusted in place, for the reason bodies are not.
