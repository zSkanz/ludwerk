// The seam between the Instance tree and skeletal animation.
//
// Exactly the shape `PhysicsSync` uses for `IPhysics3D*`, and for the same
// reason: the thing that can answer these questions is `render` (it owns the
// loaded clips and the skeleton), the thing that asks them is `script` (it owns
// the `AnimationTrack` userdata and its signal), and neither may include the
// other -- `script` is L5 and `render` is L4, but architecture.md §2 does not
// give `script` a `render` dependency and this is not the milestone to add one.
//
// So the interface lives here at L3, `render` implements it, `app` injects it,
// and `script` holds a pointer. Nothing in this header names a clip, a joint or
// a matrix: what crosses is a track id and six numbers.
//
// **Null is a real state and not an error.** A build with no render module has
// no animation host, and every call site checks -- exactly as it does for the
// physics mirror, which answers `nil` to a raycast in a world with no physics.
