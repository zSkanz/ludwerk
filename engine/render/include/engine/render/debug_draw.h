// Immediate-mode debug geometry (roadmap M1).

// Deliberately early, and not a placeholder: M2 visualizes 500 scripted
// instances through this, M3 develops hot reload against it, and M5 draws
// physics wireframes with it. The real renderer arrives in M4; until then this
// is how anything gets seen at all.
//
// Immediate-mode means the caller re-submits every frame and never holds a
// handle. `clear()` at frame start, `line()`/`wireBox()` during the frame, and
// whatever was submitted is what appears -- no retained scene, no lifetime to
// get wrong, and a caller that stops drawing something makes it disappear
// without having to remember to delete it.
