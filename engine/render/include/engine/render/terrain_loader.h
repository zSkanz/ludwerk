// Terrain on the GPU (ADR 0082).
//
// **The ground is meshes**, built on the CPU from the voxels by the mesher the
// colliders use, and drawn like any static mesh with the terrain's own shader.
// There is no height atlas and no vertex-shader level of detail any more: a cave,
// an overhang and a hillside are the same data, so they are the same draw.
//
// **A quadtree of columns of chunks carries the level of detail.** A leaf is one
// column of 32-voxel chunks, meshed at full detail; a node at level L covers
// `2^L` by `2^L` leaves and is meshed from their level-L mips -- an eighth of
// the triangles per level, and a thin wall thins rather than vanishing. Each
// node spans the whole height its chunks occupy, so two levels only ever meet
// on a vertical side, where the mesher hangs a skirt.
//
// **A change of level never shows a hole**: a node is drawn until all of its
// children are ready, and children until their parent is. Meshes are built
// nearest first, a fixed number a frame -- a count, never a clock -- and an edit
// rebuilds only the nodes whose chunks it changed.
