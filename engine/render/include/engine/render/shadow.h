// the crawling edges a human reported were the consequence. That question is
// still what this file is for; there are now four of it.
//
// **Four cascades in ONE texture, as a 2x2 atlas.** `TextureDesc` has a `layers`
// field and neither attachment struct has any way to name a layer, so a
// four-layer array can be created and cannot be rendered into. An atlas needs
// nothing the frozen RHI does not have (ADR 0037): one target, four viewports,
// one bind, one `GetDimensions`. Its whole tax is that a filter tap near a tile
// edge would read the neighbouring cascade, so every sample is clamped to its
// own tile -- four lines in `engine_brdf.hlsli`.

// The penumbra, in WORLD metres, and the texel band the kernel will accept for
// it.
//
// **This is the third answer to the same question and the first one that can be
// true, because the kernel changed underneath it.** M7.5 asked for a
// world-constant radius and clamped it to [0.8, 3.0] texels; the clamp was
// forced because a 3x3 grid cannot span more than a few texels without banding,
// and the chain's 23:1 texel ratio pushed both ends into it -- the far cascade
// ended up filtering 0.8 texels, which is nine taps inside one texel and is not
// a filter at all. Sizing the kernel in texels instead fixed that end and made
// the near end worse: with the cascade fitted to its casters a texel is about a
// millimetre and a half, so a few texels of kernel is a few millimetres of
// penumbra, and a shadow edge with no penumbra shows the texel grid it was
// rasterised on. A human saw that as dashes that crawl.
//
// What lets the radius be world-constant now is that the kernel is 7x7 with a
// variable step rather than 3x3 with a fixed one: forty-nine bilinear taps can
// cover eight texels without the gaps that made three bands.
//
// **Twenty-five became forty-nine at D054's second round**, and the reason is
// not softness -- it is the SIZE OF A STEP. A filtered shadow value is a count
// of taps, so it can only change by one tap's worth: with twenty-five, one
// texel of the map flipping moves the edge by a twenty-fifth of the penumbra,
// which measured as **3.6 pixels of jump** on a still scene at a low sun.
// With forty-nine over the same radius the same flip moves it by 0.75. The
// edge still advances in steps -- it must, with a lattice that turns -- but
// the steps are now under a pixel, which is the difference between a shadow
// that creeps and one that slides. Measured at no cost: the flagship's median
// frame did not move (`docs/perf-baselines.md`).
//
// The band is still a band because the two ends are still real, and **both of
// its numbers moved at D054**, which is the third report about the same edge.
//
// The floor is what a FAR cascade gets, because out there the authored
// penumbra is a fraction of a texel and the clamp is the only thing speaking.
// It is what decides whether the one-texel step a rotating light forces is
// visible, and two texels was not enough: a human watching from a distance
// still saw the edge advance in discrete jumps. Six is, and the measurement is
// in `docs/perf-baselines.md` -- on a still scene at forty-five metres, pixels
// changing by more than four levels between consecutive frames fell from 62 to
// 14, and the worst single change from 37 to 14.
//
// What made six affordable is that the kernel is now ROTATED PER PIXEL
// (`engine_brdf.hlsli`). The old ceiling of four existed because twenty-five
// taps spread wider than that sample the same five rings in every pixel of a
// region, which is banding; turning each pixel's grid by its own angle spends
// the same taps on different rings and the banding becomes fine noise. The
// ceiling is eight now for the same reason.
//
// The NEAR cascade is barely touched by any of this: its texel is a millimetre
// and a half, so `kShadowFilterWorldRadius` divided by it lands inside the band
// on its own and the world-space penumbra is still the five centimetres this
// file authored. Contact was re-measured at three sun elevations on
// `tests/screenshots/contact` after the change, because a wider filter scales
// the normal offset with it and that is exactly what D051 was about.
//
// **The floor came down to a texel and a half on 2026-09-22**, and this is the
// measurement that moved it. Six texels of the LAST cascade is most of a metre:
// a 0.4 m fence post seventy metres away cast no shadow at all, because the
// filter averaged it away, and every shadow in the frame read as a smear. The
// stepping six was chosen to hide is now hidden the way the reference renderers
// hide it -- a Vogel disc turned per pixel, each tap a bilinear comparison --
// and not by blurring the far cascades until their content is gone.

// face-on one does not.
//
// **In units of the FILTER's own reach**, because a kernel that reads depths
// four texels away needs an offset that reaches as far as it does, or its widest
// taps land back on the surface that cast them.
//
// **Half a filter rather than the diagonal, and D051 is why.** M7.5 set this to
// `sqrt(2)` -- a square kernel's corner is further away than its edge, and Unity
// scales its normal bias the same way (U-58). What that ignores is which acne
// this configuration can actually suffer: the shadow pass culls FRONT faces, so
// what a receiver compares against is the far side of a solid object and there
// is nothing for a lit surface to shadow itself with. The offset was therefore
// paying for a problem the cull mode already prevents, and its only remaining
// effect was to push every shadow away from the object casting it. A human sent
