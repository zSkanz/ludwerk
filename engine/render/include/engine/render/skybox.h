//
// **The frozen RHI has no cube texture** (ADR 0037), so the six faces are
// resampled on the CPU into ONE octahedral image -- the same unfolding of the
// sphere the environment already uses (ADR 0043) -- which the sky pass samples
// by direction. The same image, averaged down and taken into linear light, is
// what the environment prefilter integrates, so reflections and the sky's
// diffuse light come from the pictures rather than from the gradient.
//
// Everything here is a pure function of decoded pixels, so it runs on job
// threads and is tested without a device. `SkyLoader` owns the reading, the
// jobs and the upload.
