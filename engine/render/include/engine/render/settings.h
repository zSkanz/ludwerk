// The graphics settings family (roadmap M8; ADR 0038 §3, ADR 0044).
//
// Every number in here was `constexpr` until M8. They are **engine** settings
// and not `Lighting` properties, and the distinction is the whole design:
// `Lighting` describes the world and travels with the scene, while these
// describe the machine the scene is being shown on. A game that shipped a
// 4096-texel shadow map as scene state would be deciding how a stranger's
// laptop spends its frame.
//
// Three sources, each overriding the one before: a quality preset, the
// project's `[graphics]` table, and the host's own flags. What is deliberately
// NOT a source is a running script -- see ADR 0044 for why, and for what would
// have to be true for that to change.
//
// **Nothing here reaches the simulation.** A world hashes identically at every
// quality level, which is asserted rather than asserted-in-prose: the M8 gate
// runs the determinism replay twice at two settings.
