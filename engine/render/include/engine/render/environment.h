// The environment every surface is lit against: the sky as a function, and the
// two tables the split-sum approximation reads it through (ADR 0038, M7.5).
//
// **The environment is the sky, and that is the decision this file exists to
// make.** A prefiltered environment normally comes from an artist-placed probe,
// and v1 has no editor to place one with (ADR 0017). But the engine already
// draws a sky analytically from `Lighting`'s own state, so the same function
// evaluated on the CPU produces an environment that changes when `ClockTime`
// does -- a metal reflects the sky at the hour the script set, with no asset
// behind it and nothing to place.
//
// `evaluateSky` and `shaders/src/sky.hlsl` are therefore the same function
// written twice, in two languages, exactly like `shader_types.h` and
// `engine_pbr.hlsli` are the same bytes written twice. **Change one, change the
// other, in the same commit**: a reflection that disagrees with the sky it
// reflects is worse than no reflection at all, and `engine_render_tests` asserts
// the pair at a handful of directions rather than trusting the comment.
//
// Three things are baked here rather than on the GPU, and all three for the same
// reason: the frozen RHI (ADR 0037) has no cube texture, no mip-chain
// generation and no compute. It has `uploadTexture(texture, data, mipLevel)`,
// which takes a mip level -- so the prefilter runs on the CPU, into an
// OCTAHEDRAL 2D texture whose levels are uploaded one at a time. ADR 0043
// records what that costs and why it beat widening the interface.
