// Geometry on the GPU (roadmap M4, "Design constraints (not scope)").
//
// The roadmap requires two seams stay open here, and both are shapes rather
// than features: engine-generated geometry must be able to reach the renderer,
// and geometry that changes every frame must have an upload path that does not
// allocate every frame. Neither is built *for* a future caller -- both cost a
// parameter now and a refactor later, which is the same argument ADR 0014 made
// for `CFrame` carrying f64 from its first commit.
//
// So this takes **data, never a path**. `create` is handed vertices and indices
// that a caller already holds; where they came from -- a glTF file, a procedural
// generator, a voxel mesher -- is not this module's business and cannot become
// its business. A `RenderWorld` names geometry by `MeshHandle`, so nothing
// downstream can resolve an asset, and nothing downstream needs to.
