// The POD snapshot rendering reads (ADR 0027, architecture.md §4).
//
// Rendering never walks the ECS. It walks this, and the difference is the whole
// point: extraction happens once per frame at a known moment, so the renderer
// cannot observe a half-mutated world, cannot keep an `InstanceId` alive past
// its retirement, and can be handed to another thread the day one exists.
//
// It is a snapshot rather than a view for the same reason `scene`'s change queue
// carries POD facts: the two sides have different lifetimes and the seam is what
// keeps that from mattering.
//
// **Everything here is in camera-relative f32 space.** `CFrameD` carries f64
// because an open world needs it (ADR 0014), and a renderer does not: subtract
// the camera's position first and every coordinate the GPU sees is small.
// `origin` records what was subtracted. Deciding this at extraction rather than
// after four milestones of matrices is the M4 brief's Decision 8, and it is what
// makes the floating origin at M7 a change to one function.
