// A `Sky`'s six images, read, resampled and uploaded without the frame waiting
// (ADR 0096).
//
// **Nothing here runs on the frame thread but a poll and one upload.** When
// the faces or the orientation change, six jobs read and decode the pictures,
// eight resample bands of the octahedral image once all six are in, and a last
// one averages it into the linear copy the environment reads. The frame asks
// `jobs::finished` of that last one and, when it says yes, uploads the result.
// Until then **the previous sky keeps drawing** -- a sky that went black while
// it loaded would be worse than one a moment out of date.
//
// A headless run waits for the bake instead, so the frame a golden is taken
// from is the sky that was asked for rather than whichever frame it was ready
// by (`setSynchronous`).
