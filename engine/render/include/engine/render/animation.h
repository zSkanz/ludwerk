// Skeletal animation: clip playback and linear blending (roadmap M6,
// api-design.md §2.2's `AnimationPlayer` and `AnimationTrack`).
//
// It lives in `render` because `render` is the module that already has both
// halves: `asset`, which owns the clips a glTF file carries, and `scene`, which
// owns the tree the players sit in. `script` reaches it through
// `scene::AnimationHost`, which is the `IPhysics3D*` arrangement one layer up.
//
// **Sampling is deterministic and runs at `PreAnimation`.** Track time, `Speed`
// and `Weight` all advance on the SimClock; nothing here reads a wall clock, and
// blending walks tracks in **load order** rather than in whatever order a
// container hands them over -- R10 forbids the second, and two tracks at weight
// 0.5 have to blend the same way on every run.
//
// v1 is clip playback and linear blending. No state machines, no IK, no root
// motion and no additive or masked blending: the roadmap's words are "enough for
// idle/walk/jump".
