// Where a thing was one tick ago, so a frame can be drawn between two ticks
// (architecture.md §3, D047).
//
// **The simulation is a fixed 60 Hz and a display is not.** This machine renders
// about a hundred frames for every sixty ticks, so without interpolation two
// frames out of three show the world exactly where the previous one did while
// the third jumps a whole tick forward. A human walking `examples/10-open-world`
// described that as the world vibrating, and they were describing it precisely.
//
// `FrameScheduler` has computed the factor for this since M1 -- `Frame::alpha`,
// "where rendering sits between the last tick and the next" -- and until M8
// nothing read it. This is the consumer.
//
// **It lives in `render` and not in `scene`, deliberately.** A previous
// transform is not world state: it is not simulated, it must not enter the world
// hash, and a replay must not carry it. Keeping it here means `scene`'s
// components are untouched, `World::snapshot` still memcpys the same bytes, and
// every recorded determinism trace stays valid.
