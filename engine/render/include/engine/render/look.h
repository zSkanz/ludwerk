// The look of a world, resolved (ADR 0096).
//
// Atmosphere, a sky and the post effects are INSTANCES, and where one sits says
// whose it is: directly under `Lighting` it is the world's, directly under the
// current camera it is its viewer's, and anywhere else it does nothing. Several
// of one kind combine by rules the ADR writes down. Every one of those rules is
// applied here and nowhere else, into one POD block the renderer reads -- and the
// editor asks the same function why an instance does not count, so the marker
// it shows and the picture the renderer draws cannot disagree.
//
// **A world with none of these instances resolves to `RenderLook{}`**, and
// `RenderLook{}` is the picture the engine drew before any of them existed: the
// engine's own bloom, the linear fog, the analytic sky and nothing else. That
// is asserted rather than hoped (`look_tests.cpp`), because every golden in the
// repository rests on it.
