// The renderer contract (ADR 0027).
//
// A renderer consumes a `RenderWorld` and an `rhi::IDevice` and nothing else.
// That boundary is the whole decision: the renderer architecture -- forward,
// deferred, GPU-driven -- is a separate axis of replaceability from the graphics
// API, and this is the seam for it. An alternative renderer is a build-time
// selection like any backend (ADR 0023) and may not reach into `scene` or into
// `rhi` internals.
//
// ADR 0027's sketch is `render(IDevice&, const RenderWorld&)`. The signature
// here carries two more things the sketch predates: the command list, because
// `app` owns the frame and a renderer that opened its own could not share one
// with the debug overlay; and the target, because headless renders into an
// offscreen texture and windowed into a swapchain image, and which one is the
// host's business rather than the renderer's.
