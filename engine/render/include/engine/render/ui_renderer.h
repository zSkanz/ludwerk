//
// One pipeline, one transient vertex buffer, and one draw call per scissor run
// -- the same shape `DebugRenderer` has, and for the same reason: a 2D pass has
// no materials, no lighting and no depth, so the only thing that can break a
// batch is a change of clip rectangle.
//
// **It takes a `ui::DrawList` rather than a world.** `render` is L4 and `ui` is
// L5, so this class cannot include `ui`'s header -- and it does not need to. The
// quad type below is `render`'s own, and `app` converts. That is one copy per
// frame over a few hundred quads, and it is what keeps the layering honest
// (architecture.md §2 rule 3).
