// A surface the engine ships is compiled at the engine's build and loaded by
// name from `content/shaders/`. One a USER wrote is named by URN, and its
// bytecode comes from somebody else: the editor's compiler, which builds it on
// a worker while the frame goes on, or -- in a packaged game -- the pack, which
// carries bytecode `assetc` built. The renderer asks every frame and never
// waits: a surface that is not ready draws with the built-in surface this frame
// and is asked for again the next.
