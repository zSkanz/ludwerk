// Turning a `MeshPart`'s content URN into geometry on the GPU (roadmap M4).
//
// This is the runtime import path ADR 0010 keeps forever as the dev-mode one.
// It lives in `render` rather than in `app` because the result is GPU geometry
// and the renderer owns that; `asset` produces CPU-side data and knows nothing
// about a device, which is architecture.md §2's split.
//
// **Loading is synchronous, and that is a deliberate narrowing of this
// milestone's own brief.** Decision 1 said loads would go on the `jobs` pool
// with the result applied at the FrameStart safe point. What is here reads the
// file on the calling thread -- at that safe point, so nothing mutates
// mid-frame, but without the pool. The reason is that the pool buys latency
// hiding for a streaming system, M4 has no streaming, and a background loader
// with one caller and no eviction policy is the speculative half of the design.
// M7 is the milestone that has something to stream and is where this grows a
// queue.
