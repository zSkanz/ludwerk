// Clustered forward shading: which lights reach which piece of the view frustum

//
// Olsson and Assarsson's clustering with the grid Doom 2016 used -- 16 by 9 by
// 24 -- and exponential depth slicing, `slice = max(log2(linearDepth) * scale +
// bias, 0)`. The logarithm is the whole reason one grid serves a near plane at
// 0.1 and a far plane in the thousands: a uniform slicing would spend
// twenty-three of its twenty-four slices past the point anything is lit.
//
// **The assignment is CPU-side, and it travels as textures.** There is no
// compute in the frozen RHI (ADR 0037) and no storage buffer, so a fragment
// shader's only bulk-data route is a sampled texture -- which is fine, because
// `Load`-style point fetches need no filtering and the three tables together are
// under a hundred kilobytes a frame.
//
// What this replaces: eight lights per draw, unculled, iterated by every
// fragment (`kMaxForwardLights`, gone). The number that matters is not the new
// total but the per-cluster bound: a fragment pays for the lights that reach its
// own cluster and for no others.
