//
// In `core` rather than in the module that tweens, because two modules ease:
// `script` runs property tweens and `ui` animates a layout, and a second copy
// of these formulas would be two curves under one name.
//
// The formulas are the published ones -- Penner's, which is what every engine
// and design tool means by "quad out" -- and `tests/fixtures/easing.luau` pins
// them as literal numbers written independently from the same formulas. That
// pairing is deliberate: a fixture generated from this file would certify
// whatever this file did, which is the shape of gate M4.5 spent a milestone
