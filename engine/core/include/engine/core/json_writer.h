// A small JSON writer, the counterpart to `json.h`'s reader (ADR 0033 and its
// 2026-08-20 addendum).
//
// The reader's header says a writer would be surface with no caller, and that
// was true until M3: the dev control channel sends JSON messages over a
// WebSocket (ADR 0035), and `ludwerk test` writes a machine-readable report the
// CLI turns into TAP or JUnit rather than parsing catalog-resolved console
// prose. Two callers, both of them producing bytes another program parses.
//
// Deliberately a *writer* and not a DOM: nothing in the engine needs to build a
// document, mutate it and then serialise it. Every message here is written once
// in the order its fields appear, which is also what keeps the output stable
// enough to compare (R10) without sorting anything.
