// Interned names (architecture.md §2, §4).
//
// Instance names, property names and tags are compared and looked up far more
// often than they are created, so they are interned once into a `u32` and
// compared as integers thereafter. The child-name index (ADR 0026) and the
// property dispatch table are both keyed on atoms.
//
// **The one rule that matters: an atom's numeric value is not data.** It
// depends on the order strings happened to be interned, which depends on the
// order things happened to be created. Hashing an atom, serialising one, or
// sorting by one puts that order into observable state and breaks determinism
// (R10, ADR 0025) in a way that reproduces perfectly on your machine and fails
// somewhere else. Hash the *text*. Sort by the *text*. The atom is a fast
// comparison key and nothing else.

// dispatch are built on. Instance and property names are overwhelmingly short,
// so this would have been the common case rather than the rare one.
