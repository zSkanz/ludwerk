// The engine's content address (architecture.md §2): BLAKE3, truncated to 128
// bits.
//
// **This is a NAME, not a checksum**, and the distinction decides the
// algorithm. `WorldHash` is xxh3 because it is compared against itself -- a
// replay's hash against the same replay's hash -- so a collision between two
// unrelated worlds means nothing. A content address is the opposite: two
// distinct assets that hash alike are one asset as far as the pack, the cache
// and the manifest are concerned, and the failure looks exactly like a cache
// hit. 128 bits of a cryptographic hash is what makes "the same hash means the
// same bytes" a statement rather than a hope.
//
// Truncation to 128 bits is BLAKE3's own documented shape -- its output is an
// extendable stream and any prefix is a valid digest of that length -- and it
// halves what every TOC entry, manifest row and URI has to carry.
