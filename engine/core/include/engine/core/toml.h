// A small, strict TOML subset reader for `project.toml` (api-design.md §4).
//
// `tools/cli/toml.luau` said the engine would get one "in the milestone that
// first needs engine-side configuration, and not before". This is that
// milestone: M8's graphics settings, its window title and its application
// identity all live in the project file, and two of the three are read by the
// host rather than by the CLI -- a packaged player has no Lute in it.
//
// **The subset is the same one the CLI reads**, deliberately, because a project
// file that `ludwerk dev` accepts and the shipped player rejects is worse than
// either being stricter. Supported: comments, bare and quoted keys, `[table]`
// and `[nested.table]` headers, basic and literal strings, integers, floats,
// booleans, and single-line arrays of those. Everything else -- multi-line
// strings, inline tables, arrays of tables, dates -- is an explicit error and
// never a silent misread, for the reason the Luau reader gives: a config format
// that quietly ignores what it does not understand is how a setting ends up not
// applying.
//
// Values are addressed by their DOTTED path (`graphics.quality`), because
// nothing that reads this file walks it; every caller knows the key it wants.
