// Key + catalog localisation (ADR 0019, rule R3).
//
// Contract: engine code raises (key, params) records and never concatenates
// user-facing text. Adding a locale is adding a catalog file -- there is no
// code path that hardcodes English.
//
// v1 scope: flat JSON per locale, `{param}` placeholders, CLDR plural
// categories selected by a `count` parameter. ICU-grade formatting, dates and
// gender are reserved.
//
// **Plural rules were English's for every locale until S6.9**, which ADR 0019
// accepted at launch on the grounds that English was the only catalog shipped.
// It is now a CLDR SUBSET keyed by language subtag -- see `setLocale` -- because
// the cost of getting it wrong falls entirely on the translator: a catalog that
// offers `few` and never selects it reads as broken grammar to the people it was
// written for, and there is nothing they can do about it from their side.
