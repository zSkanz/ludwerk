// Changing one value in a `project.toml` without rewriting the file.
//
// **A project file is a document somebody wrote, not a serialised struct.**
// Every `project.toml` in this repository opens with a paragraph explaining why
// the settings in it are what they are -- which scene a run starts with and why
// that is not in `init.luau`, what `[graphics] quality` means and what it does
// not. A writer that parsed the file and printed it back would take all of that
// out, and it would do it the first time somebody moved a slider.
//
// So this edits TEXT. It finds the line the key is on, replaces what is to the
// right of the `=`, and leaves every other byte where it was: comments,
// ordering, spacing, blank lines, the keys nobody asked about. A key the file
// does not have is appended under its own table header, and the header is
// created if it is missing -- which is the only case where anything is added.
//
// **It does not validate.** `TomlDocument` is the reader and the judge; this
// answers "what would the file look like with this changed", and a caller that
// wants to know whether the result still parses parses it.
