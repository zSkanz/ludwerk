// Interned identity of a translatable message (ADR 0019, rule R3).

// Engine code never holds user-facing prose. It holds a TextKey, and the
// catalog turns that into text for the active locale. A TextKey is four bytes
// so it is free to pass around and store in error records.
//
// The key *string* deliberately lives in exactly one place -- the catalog
// (`i18n/en.json`) -- rather than being carried alongside the hash. The
// catalog therefore doubles as the hash -> name registry used for diagnostics,
// and the i18n lint guarantees every ENG_TR() literal in the source has a
// catalog entry, so "hash with no known name" is a CI failure rather than a
// runtime mystery.
