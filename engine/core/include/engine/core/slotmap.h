// Generation-checked slot storage (architecture.md §4, ADR 0028).
//
// This is the container the ECS hands out `InstanceId`s from. Two properties
// are load-bearing and neither is negotiable:
//
//   1. **Stale handles are detected, not dereferenced.** Freeing a slot bumps
//      its generation, so every handle to the old occupant stops resolving.
//   2. **Iteration is deterministic** -- ascending slot index, always. Nothing
//      here consults a hash, a pointer value, or an allocation address, because
//      simulation state must reproduce exactly (R10, ADR 0025).
//
// Note that ascending slot index is *not* insertion order once slots are
// reused, and callers must not assume it is. Determinism needs iteration to be
// a pure function of the operation sequence, which it is; anything that needs
// creation order has to record it explicitly, the way the instance hierarchy
// records sibling order in its own links.

    // it. But every generation the slot passed through in between belonged to
    // some other occupant, and handles naming those are still in the caller's

    // a stale handle would silently start resolving to a NEW object, which is

    //   * **Free** (in the snapshot, or created after it) -- its generation goes
    //     ABOVE every value it has ever held. Nothing can be resolving through a
    //     free slot, so there is nothing to preserve, and moving past the range
    //     is what stops it being reissued.
