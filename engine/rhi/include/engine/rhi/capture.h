// Reading a recorded command stream back (ADR 0005, architecture.md §9).
//
// The capture backend is the blocking render-regression gate, and it is that
// precisely because it needs no GPU: CI compares a recorded stream against a
// checked-in golden and fails on any difference. Real images are a nightly,
// non-blocking job, because a driver update should not be able to turn the
// merge queue red.
//
// This header is the seam's, not the backend's -- `app` and the test harness
// need to read a capture without linking anything that knows how one is made.

// every float is quantized to four decimals and written from an integer, so no
// libc's float formatting can make two identical frames disagree.
