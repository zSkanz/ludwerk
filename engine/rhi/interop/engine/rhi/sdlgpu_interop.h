// The SDL_GPU backend's sanctioned crack in the RHI wall -- the counterpart to
// platform/sdl_interop.h, and there for the same reason.
//
// R17 and ADR 0005 keep every SDL type out of `rhi_api`, and that is not a
// style preference: `rhi_capture` and `rhi_null` compile against those headers
// on a machine that has no SDL on its include path at all, which is the proof
// the seam is real. Widening the seam to hand out a device would end it.
//
// But Dear ImGui's SDL_GPU renderer (ADR 0011) is written against SDL_GPU. It
// needs the device, the command buffer of the frame being recorded, and the
// render pass open on it. Wrapping those would not hide SDL_GPU; it would only
// re-describe it in a second vocabulary that one caller uses.
//
// So the access is explicit, named, and lives OUTSIDE `include/`: this
// directory is on the include path only for a target that links
// `engine::rhi_sdlgpu`, so reaching it is an edit to a CMakeLists rather than
// something an `#include` can do on its own. Every accessor answers null for a
// device that is not this backend's, which is what makes calling one under
// `--rhi=null` inert rather than undefined.
