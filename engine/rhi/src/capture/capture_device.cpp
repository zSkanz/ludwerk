// The capture backend: records what was asked of the GPU, asks nothing of one.
//
// This is the blocking render-regression gate (architecture.md §9). A scenario
// runs a frame through this device, and CI compares the recorded stream against
// a checked-in golden. Because no driver is involved, a GPU vendor's update
// cannot turn the merge queue red -- real images run nightly and non-blocking
// for that reason.
//
// Everything here exists to make two runs of the same frame produce byte-
// identical text:
//
//   - Handle ids are sequential per resource kind. A pointer would make every
//     capture unique, which is why the seam uses integer handles at all.
//   - Floats are quantized to four decimals and written from an integer, so no
//     libc's float formatting can make two identical frames disagree, and a
//     last-bit difference in a matrix multiply does not fail the gate.
//   - Enums are recorded by name. Renumbering an enum should not invalidate
//     every golden, and a name is what a failing diff should show a human.
//   - **Uniform blocks are recorded by content digest, not only by size.** They
//     were recorded by size alone through M4, which is why the milestone's
//     goldens were green while the renderer lit every scene with the struct
//     defaults: every matrix, every light and every material colour a frame
//     carries travels through `bindUniforms`, and the gate was looking at how
//     many bytes went past. A gate that cannot see the values is a gate that
//     can only report that the frame still has the same shape.
//   - **And so are buffer uploads, since M7.5 (D026).** The same hole, one seam
//     over: every vertex, index and per-instance transform a frame draws travels
//     through `upload`, and that call recorded a byte count. Two UI goldens at
//     different resolutions would have been byte-identical if only the quads had
//     moved, and that is what found it. The digest is chosen by the buffer's own
//     `BufferUsage`, recorded at `createBuffer`: index data is integers and is
//     hashed exactly, everything else is floats and is hashed on the quantized
//     grid below.
//
//     `uploadTexture` is still by size, and that is measured rather than
//     conceded -- see `textureDigestIsPortable` below.

// **A hash cannot do this job, and the attempt is what proved it.** D026's fix
// first shipped as an FNV of the quantized words, exactly like the uniform
// digest below, and the two tiers disagreed on precisely the buffers whose
// contents are COMPUTED rather than read from a file: the primitive-shape meshes
// and the UI vertices. The reason is structural rather than fixable -- a hash
// has no tolerance, so a value one bit apart on either side of a quantization
// boundary hashes to two unrelated numbers, and over a few thousand floats some
// value always lands on a boundary. Coarsening the grid moves the boundaries
// rather than removing them; it was tried, and it made a third buffer fail.
//
// So the float half is described by CONTINUOUS quantities, and by MEANS rather
// than totals. That is what buys the margin: the disagreement between two
// compilers over a whole buffer is a fraction of one value's last bit divided by
// the word count, while a quad that moved or a colour that changed shifts the
// mean by orders of magnitude more.
//
//   * mean sees any value change.
//   * flow is the mean step between consecutive words, which also sees a

//     colours, bit patterns -- because integers need no tolerance and deserve
//     none. It matches on both tiers, which is measured rather than assumed.
