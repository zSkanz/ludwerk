// The Input Action System (ADR 0029, api-design.md §2.4).
//
// Three jobs, and the split between them is the design:
//
//   1. **The device snapshot.** `pumpFrame` folds a frame's platform events
//      into "what is held right now" -- a key set, a button set, axis values, a
//      pointer position, and the motion and wheel deltas ACCUMULATED since the
//      last dispatch. A snapshot rather than an event stream, because two reads
//      inside one tick must agree and because a recorded stream has to be able
//      to hand the same answers back with no hardware attached (M5 settled this
//      for the keyboard; it is the same contract).
//
//   2. **Resolution.** `dispatch*` walks the `InputContext` tree in priority
//      order, computes each enabled action's value from its bindings, and
//      writes it into the action's component. Sinking contexts consume the
//      inputs they name, so a lower-priority context bound to the same key sees
//      nothing.
//
//   3. **Telling `script`.** A value that changed enqueues a `Change` on the
//      world's queue, exactly as a property write does; `script` turns it into
//      a deferred fire. Nothing here knows what a Luau value is (R17,
//      architecture §2 rule 2).
//
// The dispatch split is ADR 0039's: an `InputContext` declares its own rate,
// `Simulation` by default. A `Render`-rate context is dispatched once per
// rendered frame and is NOT part of the recorded input stream -- a render frame
// is not a unit the replay has.
