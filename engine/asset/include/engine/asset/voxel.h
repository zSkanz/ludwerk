// A world made of blocks (V1, `VoxelService`).
//
// **This is not the terrain.** `Terrain` (ADR 0067) is a signed-distance field
// meshed into a smooth surface; this is a grid of cubes, each a block TYPE, and
// its surface is axis-aligned faces. The two share nothing but the word "voxel"
// and the copy-on-write trick below, and the owner said so in as many words.
//
// **Chunks of 16 x 16 x 16 blocks, with a y.** A block world is as tall as it is
// wide -- a mine goes down, a tower goes up -- so unlike the streaming grid's
// `ChunkId` the key has three coordinates. Sixteen cubed is 4,096 blocks and
// eight kilobytes of ids: small enough that editing one block re-meshes a
// cheap region, large enough that a chunk's mesh is a useful draw.
//
// **Immutable and shared, which keeps undo affordable**, exactly as the terrain
// does it: a chunk is a `shared_ptr`, a snapshot copies pointers, and an edit
// clones only the chunk it touches.
