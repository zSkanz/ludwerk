// Turning a `TerrainField` into triangles (ADR 0082).
//
// **The isosurface is extracted as a SURFACE NET** over occupancy: one vertex
// in each cell of the lattice of voxel centres that the surface passes through,
// at the mean of the crossings on that cell's edges, and one quad around each
// lattice edge the surface crosses, joining the four cells that share it. The
// surface is where occupancy crosses one half.
//
// It replaced marching tetrahedra in 2026-09: six tetrahedra round each cube's
// diagonal put that diagonal into every curved wall as a zig-zag. A surface net
// has no table, no ambiguous case and no preferred direction.
//
// **A region owns lattice points, and two regions side by side agree.** A region
// owns the points `[min, min + n)` on each axis and emits the quads of the edges
// that START on a point it owns. It builds cells from `min - 1`, so every such
// quad has its four cells -- and the ring of cells at `min - 1` is the ring its
// neighbour builds as its last, from the same samples, into the same vertices.
// So meshing the world a region at a time is watertight with no stitching.
