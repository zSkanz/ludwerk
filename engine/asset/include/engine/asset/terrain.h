// The terrain: one sparse grid of voxels, each a material and an occupancy
// (ADR 0082).
//
// **The whole design in one paragraph.** Space is cut into cubes `VoxelSize`
// on a side. Each one says what it is made of and how full of it it is, from
// empty to full. The surface is wherever that fullness crosses one half, found
// by interpolating between neighbouring voxels -- so a ball carved out of a
// hillside lands where the brush put it rather than on the lattice. Caves,
// arches, overhangs and flat ground are all the same data, and every consumer
// -- the mesher, the colliders, the raycast, the brushes, the save file --
// asks the same grid.
//
// This replaced a hybrid (ADR 0067) that kept most ground as a height layer and
// switched columns to voxel bricks where it stopped being one. Every defect the
// owner found in it was at the join between the two, and there is no join here.
//
// **Voxel `i` covers `[i * v, (i + 1) * v)` and its sample sits at its centre**,
// `(i + 0.5) * v`. That is the convention every function below uses when it
// turns an index into metres, and `voxelCenter` is the one place that says so.
//
// **Immutable and shared, which is what keeps undo affordable.** `UndoStack`
// snapshots the whole world by value; a chunk is a `shared_ptr`, so a snapshot
// copies pointers, and an edit clones only the chunks it writes.
