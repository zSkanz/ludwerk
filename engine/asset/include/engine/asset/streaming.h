// The policy engine for architecture.md §10's streaming pipeline.
//
// It decides WHICH chunks should be resident and in what order, and it decides
// nothing else: it does not create instances, it does not touch the scene, and
// it does not know what a chunk contains. That split is what lets the same
// manager drive a headless replay and a windowed game, and what lets it be
// tested without a world.
//
// **The budget is time, not a count** (roadmap M7's own performance note): a
// chunk's cost varies with what is in it, and the gate is stated as "zero
// hitches >33 ms attributable to streaming", so the budget and the gate measure
// the same thing. `tick` stops handing out work when the frame's millisecond
// budget is gone and resumes next frame.
//
// **Load and evict have different thresholds.** A single radius makes a focus
// standing on a boundary load and unload the same chunk every frame -- and the
// symptom is not a wrong world, it is a stutter nobody can find. The gap is
// hysteresis and it is a property of the design rather than a tuning value that
// happened to work.
