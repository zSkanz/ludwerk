// **Compiling a surface shader**, and the form a compiled one takes in a pack
// (ADR 0091).
//
// One routine for both callers: the editor's `SurfaceCompiler`, which runs it
// on a worker as a file is saved, and `assetc`, which runs it once per target
// when a project is built into a pack. Two copies of "wrap it, run
// shadercross, read the bytes back" would be two answers to what a surface
// compiles to -- and the pack is the one a player runs.
//
// It runs a process, which is why it is here and not in `surface_shader.h`:
// that header is the contract and its text, and is included by code that must
// never start one.
