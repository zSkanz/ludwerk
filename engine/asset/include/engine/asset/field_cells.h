// Terrain and block worlds cut into streaming cells (ADR 0075).
//
// **A cell is a vertical column of the world about 64 metres square**, the size
// `Terrain.CellSize` has always named. The ground and the blocks inside it are
// one file each, keyed by an `asset::ChunkId` on a grid of their own -- not the
// parts' 256 m one -- so a cell of ground is something a streaming manager can
// score, load, materialise and evict with the same policy a cell of parts gets.
//
// Everything here is a pure function of its input, so a partition run twice
// writes the same bytes, and in `ChunkId` order, so what it writes is a fact
// about the world rather than about a walk (R10).
