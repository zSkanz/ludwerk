// The `.lterrain` cell format (ADR 0067, F1 B3; version 3 by ADR 0082).
//
// **A sculpted terrain has to be saved with the project and is far too large for
// JSON.** A scene file is text so that a change to it is reviewed as a diff; a
// terrain cell is tens of thousands of samples that no human reads, and encoding
// them as decimal numbers would be an order of magnitude of waste for a review
// nobody performs.
//
// So this is binary, little-endian, and it follows the rules `chunk.cpp`
// already established -- with one of them stated here because it is the one that
// matters most: **every count is checked against a named ceiling BEFORE it is
// allocated against.** M7's own finding, in its own words: "a bounds-checked
// reader is not a safe reader, because the allocation happens first."
//
// **What is stored is the chunks exactly as the field holds them**, keys and
// voxels, so a save and a reload reproduce the same field and therefore the
// same world hash.

// as it loads (ADR 0082). It is never written. Every world saved before the
// voxel grid opens; none is saved in the old shape again.
//
// **Version 3 is chunks of voxels.** After the header, a sorted directory of
// chunk keys, then each chunk as a byte count and its voxels run-length coded
// in storage order: pairs of little-endian u16, a packed voxel
// (`packVoxel`) and how many times it repeats. A uniform chunk is one pair.
