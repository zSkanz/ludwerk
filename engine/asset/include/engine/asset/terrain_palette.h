// What terrain is made of, by name and by colour (F1).
//
// **A field stores a `u8` and nothing else**, which is right: the mesher, the
// codec and the world hash all care about the number and none of them care what
// it means. But an editor cannot show a person a number and call it a material
// palette, and a game cannot look one up by name -- so the meaning lives here,
// beside the field rather than inside it.
//
// **Built in rather than authored, for now, and that is a stated limit.** A game
// wants its own list -- `Snow`, `Ash`, `Alien Moss` -- with its own textures, and
// that needs a material asset per entry and a way to point terrain at them,
// which is the same work `BasePart.Material` describes. Until then this is eight
// entries a person can recognise, chosen so that a first world looks like
// somewhere rather than like a grey box.
