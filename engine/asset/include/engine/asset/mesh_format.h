// The engine mesh format, `.lmesh` (roadmap M7, ADR 0010).
//
// What the offline pipeline turns a glTF file into, and what the runtime reads
// back: meshopt-encoded vertex and index streams, a LOD chain, meshlets, the
// materials, and the CONTENT HASHES of the textures those materials sample --
// not the textures themselves, because a texture shared by forty meshes should
// be one blob in the pack and not forty.
//
// **A section table rather than a fixed struct.** Every section is a 4-byte
// tag, an offset and a length, sorted by tag; a reader looks sections up by
// name and ignores tags it does not know. That is what lets a later milestone
// add cluster data or a second UV set without a format break, and it is what
// lets THIS milestone leave a section out -- an unskinned mesh simply has no
// `SKIN`, rather than a zero-length one everybody has to remember to check.
//
// **Determinism is a property of the encoder** (M7 brief, Decision 1), and
// meshoptimizer has a trap in it: `meshopt_encodeVertexVersion` and
// `meshopt_encodeIndexVersion` are process-global and documented as not
// thread-safe (`meshoptimizer.h:380-385`, `:274-280`). So the format version
// pins both explicitly rather than inheriting a default, and encoding runs on
// one thread.
//
// Every offset is bounds-checked before it is followed, for the same reason
// `pack.h` gives: this decoder reads files a person may have copied, truncated
// or downloaded halfway.
