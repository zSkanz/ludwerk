// Where `asset://…` comes from (architecture.md §2 `asset::mount`).
//
// Three kinds of mount and one lookup:
//
//   * a **directory** of authored source files, which is dev mode -- a
//     `.gltf` on disk, parsed on the way in, hot-reloadable, and exactly the
//     path ADR 0010 keeps forever;
//   * a **pack**, which is what `ludwerk build-assets` produced -- compiled
//     meshes, transcodable textures, everything named by content hash, and
//     nothing to parse at load;
//   * an **object store**, which is a pack's manifest over loose blob files
//     rather than one archive. The editor writes it when it imports, so that
//     adding one mesh rewrites one file instead of a game's worth of bytes.
//
// The last two answer identically. A caller sees `Source::Pack` from either,
// because "compiled bytes, named by hash" is the same thing to everything
// above this layer, and giving the editor's store its own `Source` would put
// a branch nobody needs into every loader.
//
// A URN resolves through the mounts in reverse order, so **a later mount wins**
// and a project can override engine content by mounting after it. That rule is
// stated because the alternative -- first wins -- makes overriding impossible
// and looks identical until somebody tries.
//
// **This layer never decodes anything.** It answers "where are the bytes", and
// `mesh_format`, `texture` and `gltf` answer what they mean. Keeping that split
// is what lets the streaming manager ask for a chunk without knowing what a
// chunk contains.
