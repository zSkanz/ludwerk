// CPU-side geometry and materials (architecture.md §2 `asset`, ADR 0010).
//
// This module produces these; `render` owns every GPU upload and this header
// mentions no GPU type at all. That split is what lets a mesh arrive from a
// glTF file, from a procedural generator, or from a voxel mesher without the
// renderer knowing which -- the M4 brief's Decision 4, and one of the three
// seams the roadmap requires stay open.
//
// One glTF file is one mesh. `api-design.md` §2.6's prefab example settles it:
// a `MeshPart` names `asset://models/trunk.glb` and a second `MeshPart` names
// `leaves.glb`, so a multi-part model is multiple MeshParts rather than one
// file addressed piecewise. A file whose mesh has several primitives with
// different materials is normal and becomes several submeshes below.
