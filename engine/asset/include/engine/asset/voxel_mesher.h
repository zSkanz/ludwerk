// Turning a chunk of blocks into triangles (V1).
//
// **Greedy meshing with hidden faces culled** -- the standard answer for block
// worlds, and the opposite problem to the terrain's mesher. A block world's
// surface is quads on lattice planes; the interesting part is merging coplanar
// faces so a flat wall of a thousand blocks is a handful of triangles rather
// than two thousand. For each axis and each direction, every slice of the chunk
// becomes a 16 x 16 mask of visible faces, and the mask is swept into the
// largest rectangles of identical faces.
//
// **Faces are identical only when their block AND their ambient occlusion
// match.** Each face corner is darkened by the blocks around it (the "smooth
// lighting" every block game has, computed from the three neighbours a corner
// touches), and merging two faces with different corner shading would smear one
// face's shadow across the other. So a merge keeps the look exact, and a flat,
// unoccluded floor still merges into one quad.
