// Image encode and decode (architecture.md §2 `asset`, ADR 0010).
//
// The first thing in this module, and it arrives by moving rather than by being
// written: `app::writePng` has carried a note since M1 saying it lived in the
// host only until image IO became a real subsystem, and that this milestone was
// when it would move. Decoding is what M4 needs on top of it -- a glTF names
// PNG and JPEG textures, and stb reads both.
//
// KTX2 and basis are NOT here and are not coming in M4: they exist to be
// produced by the offline transcoder ADR 0010 puts in M7, and nothing in this
// repository can currently write one.

// terrain tool trades in sixteen-bit greyscale for that reason, so this reads a

//   which is what terrain tools export when they export "RAW". The side is the
//   square root of the sample count, and a count that is not a square is
//   refused rather than guessed at.
