// The `.lpack` content-addressed archive (architecture.md §10, ADR 0010).
//
// A pack is a header, a run of blobs, and a table of contents sorted by content
// hash. Sorted for two reasons and both matter: a lookup is a binary search
// over the TOC, and the FILE ITSELF is then a function of its contents alone --
// same inputs, same bytes, which is what makes an asset build reproducible and
// a CI cache legitimate.
//
// **Every offset is checked against the file length before it is followed.**
// That is a rule this reader is written under rather than a bug it was patched
// for: the milestone gate is a fuzz test that truncates and corrupts real packs
// and requires a structured error and no crash. A reader that trusts its own
// header is a reader that segfaults on a half-downloaded file.
//
// **The header carries a hash of the table of contents, and every open checks
// it.** The first run of the fuzz case found why: a flipped bit in an entry's
// `kind` turns a mesh into a prefab and passes every structural check, because
// nothing else in the file says what that entry should have been. Blob bytes
// are covered by their own names, header fields by their consistency with each
// other -- the TOC was the one region with neither, and 16 bytes closes it.
// Checking it on EVERY open rather than only a verifying one is deliberate: the
// TOC is what offsets are read from, and it is small enough that hashing it
// costs nothing next to the read that delivered the file.
//
// Errors are i18n keys (R3), and there are several rather than one, because a
// person holding a pack that will not open deserves to know whether it is the
// wrong kind of file, a truncated one, or one whose bytes no longer hash to
// their own name.
