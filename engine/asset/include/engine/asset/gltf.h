// glTF 2.0 import at runtime (roadmap M4, ADR 0010).
//
// Runtime rather than offline on purpose: the roadmap keeps this path forever
// as the dev-mode one, and M7's offline importer produces packs beside it
// rather than replacing it. So this has to be fast enough to sit inside a hot
// reload, which is why fastgltf is the parser (ADR 0010) and why nothing here
// allocates per-vertex.
//
// Reads `.gltf` and `.glb`, with buffers and images either embedded or beside
// the file. `baseDirectory` is what a relative URI in the document resolves
// against; a `.glb` with everything embedded never uses it.
//
// What this does NOT do, and none of it is an oversight (M4 brief, NOT in
// scope): skins and animations are skipped rather than half-imported, because
// `AnimationPlayer` ships at M6; morph targets, cameras and lights inside the
// file are ignored, because the world's camera and lights are Instances that a
// script owns, not things a mesh file dictates; and no extension beyond the
// core specification's PBR material is honoured.
