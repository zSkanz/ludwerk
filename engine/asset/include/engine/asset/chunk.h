// The chunked world payload, `.lchunk` (architecture.md §10, roadmap M7).
//
// One chunk is one cell of the uniform world grid and the instances inside it:
// what to create, where, and what it looks like. Deliberately NARROW — this is
// not a general scene serialization (api-design.md §2.6 keeps that deferred)
// and it is not a prefab format. It is the list architecture.md calls
// "serialized instance blobs", and the reason it can be narrow is that a chunk
// describes placed WORLD content rather than an authored asset.
//
// **A chunk is its own file, and that is a decision rather than an oversight.**
// A `.lpack` is read whole into memory at mount, which is exactly right for the
// meshes and textures a chunk REFERS to — one tree mesh shared by four hundred
// chunks should be resident once — and exactly wrong for the chunk payloads
// themselves, since a world bigger than memory cannot have its instance lists
// resident. So chunks resolve through `ContentMounts` like anything else and
// are read one at a time with `platform::readFileAsync`, which is the path
// architecture.md §10 describes: an IO read at the chunk's priority, a decode on
// a worker, and a budgeted materialisation at FrameStart.
//
// Ranged reads INTO a pack are the obvious later refinement and are named here
// rather than left to be rediscovered: they would let a chunk live in the pack
// without the pack being resident, and they need an IO service that can read an
// offset, which this one deliberately cannot.
