// A material asset: a `.material.json` under a project's `content/` (ADR 0090).
//
// **A material is a file and never an instance.** It has no transform, it is not
// simulated, and it has no parent that means anything in a world -- and putting
// it in the tree made every boundary of the tree a place it could be lost (D115,
// D130, D133, D142). A part names one by URN, and the library below answers what
// the URN means.
//
// Three things live here, and all three are data:
//
//   - `MaterialProperties`, the flat description a renderer draws: the same
//     thirteen fields the old `Material` class had, with the same defaults.
//   - `MaterialAsset`, what one file holds: a `parent` (a variant names one),
//     the fields it writes, and the `instanceParameters` it lets a part
//     override.
//   - `MaterialOverrides`, what one PART holds: the values it overrides, from
//     the closed set a material may declare. Trivially copyable, because it
//     lives in a component and a snapshot is a per-pool copy (ADR 0016).
//
// L2, and nothing here knows a world exists. `scene` holds a URN and a set of
// overrides; the host owns the `MaterialLibrary` that says what they mean.
