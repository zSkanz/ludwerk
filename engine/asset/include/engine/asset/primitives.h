// The five solids a `Part` can be, as CPU geometry (roadmap M6, "solid `Part`
// rendering").
//
// **This is M4's first spent constraint.** The roadmap required that
// "engine-generated geometry must be able to reach the renderer" and that "the
// mesh path cannot assume a mesh is a handle to an imported asset". These meshes
// come from arithmetic rather than from a file, go through `MeshCache::create`
// like any other, and the renderer changes not at all -- which is the answer
// that constraint was written to get.
//
// **The tessellation is a permanent decision.** Every capture golden recorded
// after this is baked against these numbers, and changing one re-records all of
// them. They are stated as constants rather than as parameters for exactly that
// reason: a segment count that a caller could pass is a segment count two
// callers will eventually disagree about.
//
// **What `Size` means per shape, and where it differs from the collider.** The
// renderer scales one unit mesh; the physics mirror builds a shape from the same
// `Size` (engine/physics/include/engine/physics/types.h). They agree exactly for
// `Block`, `Cylinder` and `Ball`, and `Wedge`'s collider is deliberately its
// bounding box. `Capsule` is the one that can diverge: its caps are hemispheres
// the collider never stretches, and a scaled mesh stretches everything. The mesh
// here is built at the character aspect -- radius 0.5, cylinder section 1, total
// height 2 -- so `Size.y == 2 * max(Size.x, Size.z)` is exact and everything
// else is a capsule with slightly oval ends. A mesh per aspect ratio is the fix
// and it belongs to the milestone that measures the cost.
