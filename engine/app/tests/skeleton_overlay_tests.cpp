// **A joint is in the MESH's space and a picture is in the world's**, and the

// (E9's opening defect, a skinned node's transform applied twice). So what these
// cases assert is not that lines appeared -- it is WHERE they appeared, for a
// part that is not at the origin and not facing down -Z.
//
// The rig is invented rather than loaded: `SkeletonHost` is a seam, and the
// whole point of a seam is that the thing above it can be tested without a
// renderer, a mesh file or a GPU.
