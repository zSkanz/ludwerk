// What is worth asserting about the overlay is not what it draws -- it draws a
// developer panel, and pixels of text are the screenshot gate's business, not a
// unit test's. It is the contract around it: that it is inert wherever there is
// nothing to draw with, that being inert costs the frame loop nothing, and that
// F3 is what turns it on where there is.
//
// And what the shell DECIDES, which is a different thing from what it draws.
// The one case below that builds the shell needs a display and a GPU device,
// and where either is missing it returns before it asserts -- so a check
// written inside it reports a pass it never ran. Every decision this shell
// makes with arithmetic rather than with pixels is therefore a function, and
// the cases at the foot of this file call those on any machine at all.
