// The render half of a content-browser preview (S5.16).
//
// **`ThumbnailCache` does every part of a preview that does not need a device**
// -- the request, the read off the frame, the parse off the frame, the budget,
// the keying, the cache -- and hands the rest through `IPreviewRenderer`. This
// is that implementation, and it lives in `app` rather than in `render` for the
// reason the seam's own comment gives: building a subtree needs a world, a world
// needs registries, and both belong to the host.
//
// **It draws through the ordinary renderer over a scratch world**, which is the
// whole design. The alternative -- assembling `RenderWorld::draws` by hand from
// an `asset::Model` -- would be a second copy of `render_world.cpp`'s extraction,
// and the two would disagree the first time either learned about a new material
// field. So a `Mesh` job becomes one `MeshPart` in a scratch world and a
// `Subtree` job becomes that text read into the same one, and both then go
// through `extract` and `IRenderer::render` exactly as a frame does.
//
// What that buys, beyond not duplicating anything: a preview is lit, shadowed
// and tonemapped by the same code as the viewport, so a model looks in the
// browser like it will look in the world.
