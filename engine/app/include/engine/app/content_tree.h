// **The content directory IS the asset manager** (human decision, 2026-08-22).
// A project's meshes, textures, chunks and **scenes** all live under `content/`,
// a scene is an asset like the rest, and opening one loads it. This is the model
// behind the panel that shows that — Unity's Project window and Unreal's
// Content Browser are the same object.
//
// **Built from the SOURCE tree on disk, not from the packed archive.** What a
// person authors is `content/`; `.engine/content.lpack` is what a build makes of
// it, and a browser that showed the pack would show yesterday's work and offer
// no way to change it. `ContentMounts` already resolves a loose file over a
// packed one for exactly this reason, and this is the same choice one layer up.
//
// ImGui-free on purpose, like `inspector.h` and `editor.h`: what a panel
// DECIDES is testable and what it draws is a screenshot's business.
