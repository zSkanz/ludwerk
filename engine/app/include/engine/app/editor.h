    // the tool and the game two authors of one transform -- a disagreement no
    // arbitration settles, because the disagreement IS the design (D061). The
    // renderer is told which view to draw through `render::ViewOverride`, and
    // while the world plays it is told nothing and draws the game's.

    //
    // **The arithmetic is `picking.h`'s and the STATE is here**: which mode, in
    // which space, and what a drag in progress started from. The split is the

    // lives where a test can reach it, and what a person is doing with a mouse
    // right now is a thing an object remembers between frames.
    //
    // **A drag is solved against where it STARTED, never against last frame.**
    // Every selected instance's transform is recorded when the button goes down
    // and the delta is applied to that, so a drag is exact however long it lasts
    // and however slowly it is made -- and so dragging three parts moves each by
    // the same delta rather than stacking them on the one the gizmo sits on.

    // --- What a click in the viewport is FOR (F1) -----------------------------
    //
    // **Not a fourth `GizmoMode`**, and the reason is worth stating because the
    // fourth mode is the obvious shape and it is wrong twice over. Mechanically:
    // `snapStep` indexes `f32 m_snapStep[3]` by the raw enum with no bounds
    // check, so a fourth value reads past the array. Conceptually: the three
    // gizmo modes are three ways to transform a SELECTION, and a brush has no
    // selection -- it acts on the ground under the pointer, which is a different
    // question from "what does dragging this handle do".
    //
    // A tool is what a click MEANS. `Select` is the editor as it has always
    // been: the manipulator gets the pointer, then a pick. `Sculpt` and `Paint`
    // put a brush in front of both, and `Blocks` puts the block world's
    // place-and-break in front of both (V1).
