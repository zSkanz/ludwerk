// The editor's surface shader compiler (ADR 0091, stage 4).
//
// **Asynchronous, cached and loud.** The renderer asks for a surface by URN
// every frame; the first ask starts a compile on a worker and answers Pending,
// so the part draws with the built-in surface and no frame waits. The compile
// runs `shadercross` -- the program the engine's own build runs, found beside
// the editor or in the build's host tools -- once per pass variant and stage,
// over the wrappers `asset::surfaceWrapper` writes. The result is cached by a
// hash of everything that can change it: the source, every file it includes,
// the contract version and the bytecode format -- in memory, and on disk so a
// second session starts warm.
//
// A shader that does not compile answers Failed -- the error surface -- and
// every error is logged with its file and line, which is what the editor's
// console shows. A saved shader or include is seen within half a second and
// recompiled; the renderer rebuilds its pipelines when the revision moves.
