// One script being edited: the text, its tokens, its diagnostics, and its own
// undo (ADR 0057).
//
// **This is the half of the code pane that can be asserted on**, which is the
// split `inspector.h` established and `ui_theme.h` restates: the ImGui shell
// cannot render headlessly and SDL does not accept injected input, so a picture
// of the editor needs a person and everything else belongs on this side of the
// line. What is left for the panel is glyphs, a caret and a scrollbar.
//
// ## Lines, and the reason is the lexer rather than the clipper
//
// The text is a `std::vector<Line>`, each line its own `std::string`. The
// clipper's read being a subscript is the obvious half of the argument; the half
// that decides it is that **Luau's lexer can be run over one line in isolation**,
// which two things in the vendored source make true:
//
//   `Lexer`'s constructor takes a `Position startPosition` and derives its line
//   counter from it (`Ast/src/Lexer.cpp:346-357`), so a lexer over line N alone,
//   built with `Position(N, 0)`, reports absolute positions with no fixup.
//
//   `peekch` is bounds-checked against the buffer size (`Lexer.cpp:437-446`), so
//   **no NUL terminator is required** and a `string_view` into one line is a
//   legal buffer whose end reads as `Eof`.
//
// A single flat buffer would have been fine for lexing and worse for everything
// else; a gap buffer or a piece table would have nowhere to hang the per-line
// state below, which is the whole mechanism that makes an edit cost one line.
//
// ## What crosses a line, and it is one thing
//
// A **long bracket** -- `--[[ ]]`, `--[==[ ]==]`, `[[ ]]`, `[==[ ]==]`. Nothing
// else in Luau spans a newline: an unterminated quoted string stops at the line
// end as `BrokenString`, and so does an interpolated one
// (`Lexer.cpp:630-637`, which returns `BrokenString` on `\r` and `\n`). So the
// state carried from one line to the next is a kind and a level, two bytes, and
// that is `LineState`.
//
// ## Columns are BYTES
//
// A `Position` column is a byte offset into the line -- not a codepoint index
// and not a pixel. Bytes are what the lexer reports, what an edit splices at,
// and what a test can write down. Moving a caret steps whole codepoints
// (`nextColumn`/`prevColumn`), and turning a column into an x is the panel's
// job, because only the panel knows the font.
//
// R3 does not apply to what this carries, for the reason `debug_overlay.h`
// states: the editor exists for whoever is building a game, never for a player.
