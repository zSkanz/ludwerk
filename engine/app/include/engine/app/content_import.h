// copies a `.gltf` and its companions into the project the way it always has;
// this is what happens next, and what happens next is that the same compiler
// `assetc` is runs over exactly those files and writes what it produced into the
// project's own object store (E9 step 12).
//
// Why the store and not a pack: a `.lpack` is one file holding everything, so
// adding to it means rewriting it -- the wrong shape for a tool where somebody
// drops one model into a folder and expects the other forty to still be there.
// A store is one file per blob plus an index, so an import appends.
//
// **This header exists so that `assetc` is named in one place.** It carries the
// basis encoder and assimp, which is exactly what `asset/texture.h` split the
// encode and the transcode apart to keep out of a shipped game -- so the whole
// unit compiles only under `ENG_DEBUG_UI`, the flag ImGui and SDL3 are already
// linked behind, and a shipping build carries no encoder at all.
