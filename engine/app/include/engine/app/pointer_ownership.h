// Who owns the mouse this frame: the person using the editor, or the game.
//
// **Four defects came out of this one question and every one was reported by a
// person** (S7.11). D049: the pointer lock did nothing at all, because the
// property was stored and read by nothing. D059: the editor opened on a project
// that locks its pointer at file scope, and had no cursor to click a panel
// with. D063: a right-drag to turn the camera hid the cursor and did not hold
// it, so it walked out of the window and reappeared somewhere else. D069: with
// the game holding the pointer, the invisible cursor still hovered and clicked
// rows in the Explorer that nobody could see.
//
// The answer was arithmetic inline in the frame loop, so nothing could reach it
// -- which is why all four arrived from a human rather than from a gate. It is a
// function here for the reason the shell's decisions are functions: a rule
// nobody can call is a rule nobody can test.
//
// Nothing in this header touches SDL or the world. It takes what is wanted and
// says what should be true, and the frame loop is what makes it so.
