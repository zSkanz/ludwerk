// The M7 gate's instrument: what a five-minute fly-through has to prove.
//
// The roadmap states the gate as "peak memory under the declared ceiling, zero
// frame hitches >33 ms attributable to streaming (frame-time histogram
// asserted)". This is that assertion, and it exists as a class rather than as
// twenty lines inside the frame loop for one reason: the gate's arithmetic is
// the part most likely to be wrong, and arithmetic inside a frame loop is
// arithmetic nobody can test.
//
// **A third check is here that the roadmap does not name**, and it is the one
// that earned its place. D032 was a streaming world that grew by a thousand
// instances every fifteen seconds and never shrank -- the frame times degraded
// smoothly from 100 fps to 35 over five minutes with no hitch anywhere, so a
// gate watching only for hitches would have shipped it. Peak memory would have
// caught it eventually, but only with a ceiling tight enough to be a nuisance.
// What actually distinguishes a streaming world from a growing one is that the
// instance count FLATTENS, and that is a thing to measure directly.

    // than round. Asking instead whether ANY place is visited early and again
    // late makes the same claim and covers that path, a patrol, a figure-eight
    // and a circuit alike.

    // from nothing at whatever speed the machine has (D186). Every revisited
    // place counts, and the verdict is the median of each side: what a moving

    // single places either way; a leak lifts all of them.
