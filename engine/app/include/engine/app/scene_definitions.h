// The scene's tree as types (ADR 0078): what `workspace` holds, so that
// `workspace.Player.Walker` is a `CharacterBody` to the analyzer and a typo in
// the path is still an error.
//
// **The same idea a source map gives a language server**: the engine declares
// every class, and only the project knows its own tree. So the tree is written
// down as a second definitions file, `.engine/types/scene.d.luau`, loaded after
// `engine.d.luau`. Its `declare workspace:` replaces the plain one -- the later
// declaration wins -- with `Workspace & { ... }`, an intersection the analyzer
// reads child by child.
//
// Rewritten by the editor on every save and when it opens a project, and by
// `engine-host <project> --write-types`, which `ludwerk setup` and `ludwerk check`
// run. A child a script creates at run time has no declared name and is not in
// it; `FindFirstChild` or a cast reaches that one.
