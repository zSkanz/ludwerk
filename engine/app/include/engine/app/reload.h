// The fast world restart (ADR 0024 and its 2026-08-20 addendum; M3 brief

//
// The whole model in one sentence: a reload destroys and rebuilds `WorldHost`,
// and nothing above it. The window, the RHI device, the renderer, the shader
// cache and the debug-draw state are owned by the frame loop, so "engine-side
// content survives" is a C++ lifetime rather than a promise anyone has to keep.
//
// The order is build-then-destroy, not destroy-then-build. A project that fails
// to mount -- one syntax error in one entry script, which is the common case in
// a loop whose point is that you save often -- leaves the previous world
// running and reports why.
