// It shares `ReplayScenario` with the determinism harness on purpose: a
// benchmark scene that is not also a deterministic scene is measuring something
// different on every run, and the number it reports would mean nothing.
//
// This is the one place in the engine allowed to read a wall clock as part of
// its purpose. R10 forbids *simulation* code from reading one; a harness that
// measures elapsed time has no other instrument.
