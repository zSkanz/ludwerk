// Turning a click into an instance.

// This header exists as arithmetic rather than as a UI callback on purpose. A
// picking bug reproduces by clicking, and a bug that reproduces by clicking is
// one nobody fixes twice: the aspect-ratio error that is exactly right at the
// centre of the screen and wrong at every edge is the canonical example, and it
// is invisible to anyone testing by aiming at what they meant to hit. Everything
// here takes numbers and returns numbers, and `picking_tests.cpp` aims at the
// corners.
//
// **The ray's origin is f64 and its direction is f32**, which is ADR 0013 and
// ADR 0014's split applied where it belongs: a world position four kilometres
// out needs the precision, a direction never does.

// and anything at all transparent, and an object that cannot be clicked is an
// object that has to be found in a tree view by name. The cost is that an
// invisible part can take a click; the alternative is that it can never take
// one.
//
// Ties break on the lower instance id, so a pick is reproducible when two faces
// are coplanar -- which is the flagship's terraced ground everywhere.
//
// **Everything is tested as its box, including a ball, a cylinder and a mesh.**
// A `MeshPart` carries the same transform and extents as any other part, so its
// box is its bounds and a click near a concave mesh's corner can land on
// nothing visible. This is an approximation and it is written down rather than
// discovered: a milestone that adds shape-exact picking will find this comment,
// and until one does, being able to select a mesh at all is worth more than
// being unable to miss it.
// **`root` is the same root the renderer draws from, and passing it is not
// optional.** Picking used to walk the whole part pool, which is not the same
// set as the one on screen: an instance that is in the world's pools but not
// under the root is never drawn -- and was still pickable, so a click landed on
// an outline around nothing. A part orphaned by anything at all becomes
// permanently clickable and permanently invisible, and `clearScene` cannot
// reach it to remove it either, because that walks the root's children too.
//
// The rule is one sentence: **you can pick what could be drawn.** Transparent
// and non-colliding stay pickable, for the reasons above; not-in-the-world does
// not, because it is not a thing the person is looking at. And it is picked
// where it IS drawn (`poses`, ADR 0134): a part moving in a running game was
