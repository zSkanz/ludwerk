// The developer overlay (ADR 0011): Dear ImGui on the docking branch, bound to
// F3, drawn on top of the finished frame.
//
// Dev builds only. ADR 0011 compiles ImGui out of shipping entirely, and the
// build expresses that by not declaring the dependency at all
// (ENG_DEBUG_UI, third_party/CMakeLists.txt). What is left in that profile is
// this class with the same shape and methods that do nothing -- so the frame
// loop calls it unconditionally and carries no #ifdef.
//
// It is also inert wherever there is nothing to draw with: `--rhi=capture` and
// `--rhi=null` have no GPU device, and a headless run has no window. That is a
// normal outcome, not a failure, and `active()` is how a caller asks.
//
// R3 does not apply to what this draws. The overlay exists for whoever is
// building the engine, never for a player, so its labels are literals rather
// than catalog keys -- the same reason a GPU debug-group name is one.
