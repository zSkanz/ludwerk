// a build step is a thing to forget. A shipping build pre-warms this same
// directory and is not a second code path -- `ludwerk build` copies `.engine/`
// into the artifact, so a cache warmed here travels with the game.
//
// The cache is keyed by the scene's own content hash and validated against the
// stamps the partition read: a scene that names a lamp post has to repartition
// when the lamp post changes, and nothing in the scene's own bytes would say
// so. A cache that answered stale would be a world with yesterday's buildings
// in it, which is the failure the whole thing exists not to have.
//
// It also owns the layering the partitioner cannot: `scene` has no filesystem,
// so it hands cells to a sink and this is the sink.

// a world out of memory until you are near it; a scene that fits in three cells
// is entirely inside any sensible load radius, so nothing is ever evicted and
// the whole thing is resident from the first pump either way.
//
// What it DOES cost is tree identity. A partitioned record carries no parent
// path -- by design, because a path into `Workspace` is sometimes nil in a world
// that is not all present, which is why ADR 0053's rule 5 makes tags the way to
// address streamed content. So a small project that got partitioned found its
// authored `Model` empty and its parts somewhere else, and the only way out was
// to know the words `StreamingMode = "Persistent"`. The starter template said
// them, about fifteen parts, in order to appear at all.

// Four rather than two, so a scene straddling a cell boundary is not streamed by
// accident: a single room centred on a corner lands in four cells and is still a
