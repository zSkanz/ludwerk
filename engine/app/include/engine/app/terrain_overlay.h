// Drawing the terrain's own triangles and normals, for `View > Terrain
// Wireframe` and `View > Terrain Normals` and for `DebugService:ShowPanel
// ("Terrain")` in a running game (the owner's terrain report, 2026-09-23).
//
// **The rendered terrain is a picture of the mesh, and the mesh is what the
// report was about.** Black regions, faces that vanish at some angles, stretched
// triangles, seams: each is a claim about the triangles, and the shaded picture
// cannot tell a wrong normal from a dark material or a hole from a shadow.
// These lines can.
//
// - **Wireframe**: every triangle's edges, green where the triangle's winding
//   agrees with its vertices' normals and red where it does not -- so an
//   inverted face is a red triangle rather than a guess.
// - **Normals**: a short yellow line along each vertex's normal, which is what
//   the shader lights by.
//
// Meshed at full detail around the camera and cached until the ground or the
// camera's cell changes, because the renderer's own meshes live on the GPU and
// the whole point is to show the CPU's answer.
