// Record/replay harness v1 (ADR 0025, architecture.md §9 "Determinism tests").
//
// A replay is pure simulation. It creates no device, no window and no swapchain,
// because none of those may influence the world -- and a harness that boots them
// anyway would be unable to say so. What it produces is a *trace*: the world
// hash sampled at a fixed tick interval, which is a far more useful failure
// report than a single number at the end. Two runs that diverge at tick 4200
// tell you where to look; two final hashes that differ tell you nothing.

// One key changing state at one tick. The whole of a scenario's INPUT, as
// opposed to its script -- which is the distinction that makes "input replay"
// mean anything (roadmap M5's first gate item).
//
// Before M5 a scenario's script WAS its input, which was honest while nothing
// could be steered. A bot that calls `Move` directly proves the simulation is
// deterministic and proves nothing about the path a keystroke takes to reach
// it; this replays the keystroke.
// One recorded transition. `keyCode` is an `Enum.KeyCode` value, which spans
// the keyboard, the mouse and the gamepad -- M5 recorded `platform::Key` alone,
// because the keyboard scaffold was the only path input had.
//
// An analogue line sets `axis` instead of a press: `900 = LeftStickX -0.5`.
// Both shapes are one struct because a recording is read in tick order and a
// second vector would have to be merged back into that order anyway.
