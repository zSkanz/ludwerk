// The DebugShell's explorer and properties panel, minus ImGui (M4 brief,
// Decisions 14, 15 and 16).
//
// This is the half of the panel that can be asserted on: which properties a
// class exposes, which widget a `ValueType` gets, what an edit becomes before
// it reaches the world, and *when* it reaches it. The ImGui half lives in
// `debug_overlay.cpp` and draws exactly what this decides -- pixels of text are
// not something a unit test can hold, and everything else here is.
//
// Three rules shape it, and each is a decision the brief already made:
//
//   * **One generic sweep, no code per class** (Decision 16). `collectProperties`
//     walks the generated descriptor tables, so a class added in a later
//     milestone appears in the inspector with nothing written for it. There is
//     no switch on a class name in this module, and needing one would be a
//     finding about ADR 0017's promise rather than a feature of the panel.
//   * **Writes go through `scene::World::setProperty`, and nowhere else**
//     (Decision 14). A component poked directly would bypass the change queue,
//     so a `Changed` would never enqueue its property-changed fire, a
//     `readOnly` property would be writable from the overlay and not from a
//     script, and the world hash would move with nothing in the log saying why.
//   * **Writes are applied at the FrameStart safe point** (Decision 15). The
//     overlay draws after the sim has ticked and after `extract`, so applying
//     an edit where it is typed would mutate the world after the tick the frame
//     came from -- the mid-frame mutation the scheduler already refuses for hot
//     reload. The panel enqueues; `applyPending` drains one frame later.
//
// Compiled into every profile, shipping included, where the overlay draws
// nothing and the queue is therefore always empty. That is what lets the frame
// loop call `applyPending` unconditionally and stay free of `#ifdef`s
// (ADR 0011), for the same reason `DebugOverlay` keeps its shape there.
//
// R3 does not apply to the text here, for the reason `debug_overlay.h` states:
// the overlay exists for whoever is building the engine, never for a player, so
// its labels are literals rather than catalog keys.
