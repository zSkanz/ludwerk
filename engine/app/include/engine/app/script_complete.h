// Autocomplete, from the engine's own reflection (ADR 0057).
//
// **Not from `Luau.Analysis`, and that is a decision rather than a shortcut.**
// `cmake/engine_luau.cmake` records that Analysis was 35% of a cold build's
// compile time and excludes it, and ADR 0018 makes type checking `luau-analyze`
// -- a tool, never a runtime dependency. Linking it here would reverse both for
// a feature that does not need it.
//
// What it needs is already in the binary. `ClassRegistry` holds every class,
// property, method and event with the doc string the IDL wrote, generated from
// `api/defs/*.api.luau` -- the same tables the property grid already walks with
// no switch on any class name. Completion resolves the token before `.` or `:`
// to a class and lists its members through the hierarchy, plus the identifiers
// the file already contains and the keywords.
//
// **And Luau's own surface is offered too**, from `script::stdGlobals` and
// `script::stdLibraries` -- `typeof`, `pcall`, `math.floor`, `string.format`,
// `table.create`, `buffer.readf32`, all of it. That list lives beside the
// sandbox rather than here because it is a fact about the VM, and it is checked
// against a real sandboxed VM in both directions so that bumping the Luau pin
// fails a test instead of quietly leaving this a version behind.
//
// **It is this engine's surface, not stock Luau's**: `os` carries three names
// because `removeUnsafeGlobals` takes `difftime` off, and `getfenv`, `setfenv`
// and `newproxy` are not offered because they are not there.
//
// **And the WORLD is the other half of it**, which is the half a type checker
// would not have. `Workspace.MainCamera` is not a fact about the `Workspace`
// class -- it is a fact about this project's tree, sitting in memory two panels
// away from the tab being typed into. So a dotted path is walked instance by
// instance from the DataModel, and what it resolves to offers its CHILDREN
// beside its members: the names somebody is reaching for are the names in their
// own Explorer. The same walk answers inside `WaitForChild("` and
// `FindFirstChild("`, where the thing being typed is a child's name in quotes
// and nothing about the class could ever say what it is.
//
// **What it does NOT do, stated so nobody reads the absence as a bug**: infer a
// type across an expression. `local p = workspace.Baseplate` followed by `p.` is
// not resolved, because knowing that would be type inference and type inference
// is `luau-analyze`. What IS resolved is the vocabulary somebody actually forgets
// -- which service has which member, and how each one is spelled.
