//
// Fixed is the requirement, not the shortcut. A thumbnail drawn through the
// scene's camera changes when the camera moves, which means a folder of models
// looks different every time it is opened and two people looking at the same
// project see different pictures of the same file. So the view is a pure
// function of the asset's own bounds and of nothing else, and this is that
// function -- one definition, used by both rendered kinds, because "framed to
// its bounds" stated twice is two answers the first time either is touched.
//
// **Three-quarter, which is the convention rather than a preference**: above, in
// front and to one side, so a box reads as a box and a character reads as facing
// somewhere. Every asset browser worth using draws models this way, for the
// reason a straight-on view of a cube is a square.
//
// **Framed against the bounding SPHERE, not the box.** A sphere subtends the
// same angle from every direction, so the distance cannot depend on which way
// the fixed view happens to point and a model cannot fall out of frame because
// it is long along the axis the camera looks down. It costs a little empty space
// around a flat asset, which is the right way to be wrong.

// **The seam the render half plugs into.**
//
// A preview is a render, and a render needs a device, a command list, a pass and
// a set of pipelines -- all of which live in `render`, which this module may
// call and does not own. So the pipeline that FEEDS a preview is here (the
// request, the read off the frame, the parse off the frame, the budget, the
// keying, the cache) and the pass that DRAWS one is behind this interface.
//
// The contract, in the order it matters:
//
//   - **Called from `ThumbnailCache::flush`**, which is the frame's upload
//     window: a live command list, no render pass open. The implementation opens
//     and closes its own, exactly as `IRenderer::render` does and for the same
//     reason -- whatever runs after it in the frame expects none open.
//   - **At most `MaxPreviewsPerFrame` calls per `flush`.** See that constant: a
//     preview is an upload plus a pass, and neither can be split.
//   - **Frame it with `previewView`** -- over `model->mesh.bounds` for a `Mesh`,
//     and over the materialised subtree's extents for a `Subtree`. A subtree is
//     built at the origin, so the f64 answer `scene::worldExtents` gives
//     converts to the f32 box this takes without losing anything.
//   - **One neutral light, and the project's `Lighting` is not consulted.** A
//     preview that inherited the scene's sun would change when somebody dragged
//     a slider in a panel three tabs away, which is the same defect as a preview
//     that follows the camera.
//   - **The texture belongs to the CACHE from the moment this returns true.** It
//     is destroyed on eviction and at `destroy`, so it must be created on
//     `device` and it must be `Sampled` -- the browser draws it.
//   - Returning false means "there will never be a picture of this file": the
//     entry is remembered as failed and the file is not opened again. A renderer
//     that is merely busy must not report it.

// **A picture's row in the content browser shows the picture.**

// An icon says "this is an image"; the file name already said that. What

// no icon can answer it -- the whole reason every asset browser worth using
// draws the thing itself. **The same sentence is true of a folder of forty
// models**, and it is worse there: forty meshes wear one `ContentMesh` icon, so
// the panel says nothing at all except how many files there are.
//
// Three costs make this a cache rather than a `decodeImage` in the draw loop,
// and each one is a way the naive version fails on a real project:
//
//   - **Size.** A 4K PNG is 64 MB as RGBA8. A folder of forty is more VRAM than
//     the world it is meant to decorate, spent on pictures drawn at 96 px. So
//     what is uploaded is a downscale, at `Edge` on the longer side, and the
//     full-size decode is thrown away in the same breath it was made.
//   - **Time.** See below: it is the reason this is a pipeline.
//   - **Count.** Scrolling never ends. `Resident` is a hard ceiling with
//     least-recently-drawn eviction, so a project with nine thousand textures
//     costs exactly what a project with two hundred does.
//
// **Three stages, because the work does not fit in a frame.** Measured on
// ordinary 1024-square PNGs from a texture pack: 14 to 36 ms to decode and 2 ms
// to resample, EACH. That is a whole frame at 60 Hz and eight at 240, so a
// budget on the main thread cannot help -- an image cannot be decoded half way,
// and a floor of one per frame is a floor of one dropped frame per thumbnail. At
// 4K it is sixteen times worse. A mesh is worse again: 21 ms to read and **191
// ms to parse** the 2937 KiB glTF D125 was opened for.
//
// So the file is read by `platform::readFileAsync`, the decode -- an image
// resampled, or a glTF imported -- runs on the job pool as `Domain::AssetIo`,
// which is what that domain is defined as ("decode, transcode, materialisation
// preparation"), and only the upload happens on the frame, because only the
// frame has a command list. Opening a folder of 4K textures costs the main
// thread a few small uploads and nothing else.
//
// **A rendered preview adds a fourth stage and a budget of its own**, because it
// is the one kind whose expensive half genuinely cannot leave the frame: see
// `MaxPreviewsPerFrame` and `IPreviewRenderer`.
//
// A picture is therefore ready some frames after it was first asked for, and the
// row draws its icon until then. On a panel that stays open, that is a browser
// filling in rather than an editor hanging.
