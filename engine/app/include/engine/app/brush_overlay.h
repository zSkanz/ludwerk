// **A drag is sampled once a frame and a brush is not a rubber stamp**: at a
// hundred and twenty frames a second a slow drag stamps on top of itself, and at
// thirty a fast one leaves a dotted line of craters with gaps between them. So
// the stroke is walked at a fixed spacing in WORLD space rather than once per
// frame, which makes the result a function of where the pointer went and not of
// how fast the machine was.
//
// `spacing` is a fraction of the radius: a brush that stamps every quarter of
// its own width overlaps enough to read as a stroke. Zero or negative spacing
// falls back to one stamp at `to`, because a spacing that cannot advance would
// otherwise be an unbounded loop.
//
// **`from` equal to `to` is one stamp, not none.** That is the first frame of
// every drag and also a click, and a brush that did nothing until the pointer
// moved would feel broken in exactly the case somebody tries first.
//
// **The walk starts at `from` and the remainder is left at the `to` end**, so a
// caller continuing a stroke resumes from the last stamp exactly and the
// unwalked fraction is carried by the pointer into the next frame. Stamping `to`
// instead would put that fraction at the `from` end where a continuing caller
// drops it, and the loss accumulates -- see the source for the numbers.

// **This is the other half of "a drag is not a rubber stamp", and without it
// `strokeStamps` alone is not enough.** `strokeStamps` always stamps `to`, which
// is right for a click and for the end of a segment; called every frame with the
// pointer's current position it would stamp once per frame again, and the ground
// left behind would depend on the framerate after all. So a stroke advances only
// in whole steps: below one, the frame stamps nothing and the stroke's anchor
// stays where it was, accumulating the movement until it is worth a stamp.
//
// The visible cost is that the newest stamp can lag the pointer by up to one
// step -- a quarter of a brush width at the default spacing, which is inside the
// brush that is already there. The ring is what follows the pointer exactly.
