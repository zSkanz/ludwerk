// The editor-seam proof (roadmap M8; ADR 0017's standing condition).
//
// ADR 0017 declined a visual editor for v1 on the explicit condition that
// nothing in v1 hard-codes an assumption that blocks one. The concrete thing a
// phase-2 editor needs first -- and what prefab-isolation mode is made of -- is
// **two `WorldHost`s alive at once**, each with its own `ScriptRuntime`, which
// is two Luau VMs, rendered into two targets.
//
// Networking is the second caller and the reason this matters more than it did
// when it was only the editor's: the post-v1 multiplayer design puts an
// authoritative world and a replica in one process over a loopback transport,
// which is impossible if anything here assumes one world.
//
// **Why this is a mode and not a unit test.** Two hosts that both construct
// prove nothing -- a global both of them scribble into would still construct.
// What has to be proven is that the two are INDEPENDENT, and the only
// instrument that can say so is a differential over what each one draws:
//
//   - each world's image, rendered while the other is alive, must be
//     byte-identical to that world rendered alone, and
//   - the two images must differ from each other.
//
// The first half catches a shared static: if world B's contents reach world A's
// frame, A stops matching its own solo render. The second half catches the
// vacuous pass -- two empty worlds agree perfectly (D043 is what that costs).
//
// Like `--replay` and `--bench` this is a mode rather than a flag on a normal
// run: it owns its own device, its own frame loop and its own exit, because
// what it measures is three sessions compared against each other.
