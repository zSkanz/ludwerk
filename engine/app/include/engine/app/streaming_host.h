// Where the streaming pieces meet (roadmap M7, architecture.md §10).
//
// Four modules own a quarter of this each and none of them can see the others:
// `asset` decides which chunks should be resident, `platform` reads them,
// `scene` turns them into instances, and `script` holds the coroutine a
// `LoadAreaAsync` parked. This is the one place that knows all four exist,
// which is what `app` is for.
//
// It also owns the origin. The trigger for a rebase is a focus leaving its
// tolerance, and the focus set is streaming's -- so the decision belongs here
// rather than in the physics mirror, which has no idea where the camera is.
