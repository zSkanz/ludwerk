// The editor's icons, resolved from a theme and packed into one atlas.
//
// **This is the only thing that knows about themes**, which is what
// `icons/README.md` asks for and what makes a plugin theme a case in a list
// rather than an edit at every call site. A caller asks for a logical id and a
// size and gets a texture and four texture coordinates; where the picture came
// from is this file's business.
//
// ## The ids
//
// Three namespaces, and the prefix says which question the icon answers:
//
//   `class.<ClassName>`   the Explorer's rows, and the lookup is mechanical --
//                         `"class." + the class's own name`
//   `content.<Kind>`      a `ContentKind` from `content_tree.h`
//   `action.<Name>`       something a person clicks
//
// `icon_ids.gen.h` carries them as constants generated from
// `icons/default/theme.json`, so a typo is a compile error and a missing icon
// is a build failure rather than a blank square. The class ids are still looked
// up by string, because the Explorer draws whatever class the world holds and a
// project may register one this build has never heard of -- that lookup misses
// and falls back, which is the designed behaviour and not a defect.
//
// ## What a theme is, and why a partial one is legal
//
// A directory with a `theme.json`. **Only `default` has to be complete**, and
// that rule is what makes overriding one icon cost one file: a plugin or a
// project ships the ids it cares about and inherits the rest. A miss walks the
// chain to `default` and then to `default`'s own `fallback` id.
//
// ## Why one atlas at a few fixed sizes
//
// The masters are 256 px and the panels draw at 16 to 32. Sampling a 256 px
// image down to 16 with the UI's bilinear filter takes two texels out of two
// hundred and fifty-six, which is not a small icon but a smudge -- so every
// size the editor asks for is box-filtered once, at load, into one atlas.
//
// One atlas rather than sixty-seven textures because the tree redraws every
// frame and ImGui batches by texture: seventy binds a frame for a panel is a
// profile artefact somebody eventually has to explain.
//
// ## Tint
//
// Every image is a MASK: white everywhere, with the meaning in the alpha. One
// file therefore serves a light panel and a dark one, multiplied by a colour at
// draw time. There is no second set for dark mode and there must not be -- two
// drawings of one icon drift the first time somebody touches one of them.
//
// **And the colour says what KIND of thing it is, never which thing.** The shape
// carries the identity; the tint only makes a long tree scannable. A theme
// declares a `palette` of a dozen ROLES and a sparse `roles` map from id to
// role, and an id nobody names takes `defaultRole` -- which is why a toolbar is
// one colour with four exceptions rather than a fruit salad.
//
// Two values per role, `light` and `dark`, and they are not two decisions: a
// single colour cannot clear 3:1 against both a near-white panel and a dark one,
// and everything in the band that does is muddy. They are solved from one hue so
// nobody picks the second by eye.
//
// **Tinting is switchable off**, and with it off every icon takes the panel's
// own foreground -- which is where this started. The set was drawn and
// collision-checked in a single ink before any colour existed, so the uncoloured
// editor is not a degraded one, and somebody who cannot use the colours must not
// get a worse tool.
