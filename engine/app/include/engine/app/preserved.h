// `PreserveOnReload` (ADR 0024, api-design.md §3.2, M3 brief Decision 5).
//
// A tagged instance has the same problem as the state bag: the `scene::World`
// it lives in is what a reload destroys. So it is captured as a *description* --
// class, name, ancestry, properties, attributes, tags, and its whole subtree --
// and re-created in the world the reload builds, **before** the new entry
// scripts are deferred. A script that looks for what it left behind therefore
// finds it already there, and `HotReloadService:IsReload()` is how it knows to
// look instead of building it again.
//
// Everything here is text and values rather than ids and atoms: an atom belongs
// to one world's `AtomTable` and an `InstanceId` to one world's slot map, and
// the whole point is that neither world is the other.
