// Writing what the engine rendered to a file the agent can look at.

// This is the second half of "the agent needs eyes before it needs features"
// (roadmap M1). rhi::IDevice::readTexture gets the pixels off the GPU; this
// gets them onto disk in a format `tools/imgcmp` can compare against a
// reference. Everything from M4 onward gates on that comparison.
//
// The encoding and the file moved to `asset::writePng` at M4, as this note used
// to promise they would. What is left here is the name the host calls, kept
// because `--screenshot` is the host's feature and its callers should not have
// to know which module owns a PNG encoder.
