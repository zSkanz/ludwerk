// The dev-server control connection (ADR 0035, M3 brief Decision 1 and the
// protocol section beside it).
//
// The engine dials out to `ludwerk dev`'s WebSocket server and speaks one JSON
// object per text frame. Only the dev server listens; this opens no port, and
// the whole file compiles into dev builds only.
//
// All socket I/O happens on this object's own thread. The frame loop never
// touches the connection: it takes whatever arrived at the FrameStart safe
// point and posts replies, which the thread sends. That is what keeps a reload
// from landing mid-tick, which is the rule architecture §4 states and the one
// that makes within-run determinism survive having a watcher attached.
