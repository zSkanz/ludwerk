// Drawing the streaming grid in the world (E5's last gate row).

// **The Stats panel already prints the chunk states and that is not the same
// thing.** A grid of letters tells you eleven cells are resident; it does not
// tell you WHERE the seam is, which cell the character is standing in, or that
// the ring is lopsided because a focus is off by half a cell. Streaming is a
// question about space, and the answer belongs in the space.
//
// It is also the only form of the answer a gate can capture. E5 owes a
// screenshot of the chunk state and has owed it since the milestone closed,
// because the ImGui shell cannot render headlessly -- and a picture drawn
// through `DebugDraw` goes through the ordinary renderer, which
// `--headless --screenshot` already captures. So the version that is better for
// a person is also the version that can be gated, which is why this exists
// rather than a way to screenshot a panel.
//
// Behind a switch, like the physics wireframe: `DebugService:ShowPanel`
// ("Streaming") in a game, `View > Streaming Grid` in the editor.
