// A terrain saved as a folder of cells, edited and played (ADR 0087).
//
// **The one place that knows a scene's ground can live beside it.** The field
// streamer streams cells and knows nothing of scenes; the scene writer names an
// index and knows nothing of files; the editor saves and knows nothing of
// cells. This joins them: it adopts the index the workspace's terrain names,
// keeps the streamer's picture in step with an undo, and on a save writes the
// cells that changed -- or, for a terrain grown past what a scene should carry,
// all of them, and from then on the scene names them instead.
