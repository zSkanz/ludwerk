// Terrain and block worlds streamed from disk (ADR 0075; F1 Part E).
//
// **The same policy as parts, over a grid of its own.** A partition cuts the
// field into cells of about 64 metres (`asset/field_cells.h`) and this streams
// them with an `asset::StreamingManager` of its own -- its own index, because a
// `ChunkId` on this grid names a different square from the same id on the
// parts' 256 m one -- scored by the same squared distance, evicted by the same
// hysteresis, and held to the same frame budget.
//
// **What goes in, and what comes out.** A cell that arrives is shared into the
// live field: what the field already holds there wins, because it is newer.
// The cell is then KEPT, and that second reference is the whole of how an edit
// is noticed -- the field is copy-on-write, so the first write to anything the
// cell brought clones it, and at eviction a cell whose objects are no longer
// the ones it brought, or whose square holds something it did not bring, is
// left where it is. Nobody raises a flag, so nobody can forget to: a cell a
// script dug into, or a player built on, is never streamed away with the work.
//
// **The ground arrives before the simulation runs on it.** Until the minimum
// ring around every focus has been resident once, `primed` is false, and the
// host holds its ticks -- the initial load every streamed world has, so a
// character spawned on streamed ground does not fall through it on frame one.
// After that, `StreamingService.PauseOutsideLoadedArea` decides, as it does
// for parts.
