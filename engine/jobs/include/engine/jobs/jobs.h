// The engine's CPU work pool (architecture.md §2, L1).
//
// Two rules define this module, and both are contracts rather than advice:
//
//   1. **No blocking IO here.** A worker that blocks on a file read is a worker
//      that is not stealing work, and the pool has no way to know it. Async IO
//      is `platform::readFileAsync`, which owns its own queue; jobs DECODE what
//      IO delivers.
//   2. **Nothing about which worker ran what may become observable simulation
//      state** (R10). The pool makes no promise at all about execution order,
//      and offers `StableCommit` (commit.h) as the sanctioned way to get an
//      answer that does not depend on it: per-job buckets, a barrier, and a
//      merge in bucket-index order.
//
// An UNINITIALIZED pool is a serial pool: `schedule` runs the callable
// immediately on the calling thread and returns a handle that is already
// finished, and `parallelFor` walks its ranges in order. That is not a
// degraded mode to apologise for -- it is the mode every headless determinism
// run and every unit test wants, and having it be the default means no caller
// needs an `if (poolExists)` branch.
