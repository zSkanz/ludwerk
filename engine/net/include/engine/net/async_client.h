// Blocking network calls, off the VM's thread (api-design.md §7).
//
// `@std/net.request` yields the calling coroutine and the engine resumes it when
// the answer is here. Something has to do the waiting, and it cannot be the
// thread running Luau: a two-second request on the VM thread is a two-second
// frame.
//
// **Its own threads rather than the job system's** (`jobs/jobs.h`). That pool is
// sized to the machine's cores and exists to keep them busy; a worker parked on
// a socket for two seconds is a core the frame's work cannot have. Threads that
// are ALLOWED to block are a different resource from threads that must not, and
// conflating them is how a job system acquires a mysterious stall.
//
// **Completions are taken, never delivered.** Nothing here calls back into the
// VM: the host takes finished tickets at a point the frame loop chooses, the
// same shape `ITransport::poll` has and for the same R10 reason. A callback
// firing off a worker thread would be game code entering at a wall-clock moment.
