// **Why this exists beside ENet rather than instead of it.** ENet's loopback is
// a real socket, so what it delivers and when is decided by the operating
// system's scheduler -- which is exactly the thing a deterministic gate cannot
// depend on. Replication has to be tested as a function of the operation
// sequence (R10): the same sends, the same polls, the same bytes out. These
// deliver what was sent at the next `poll`, in order, every time, and the lossy
// decorator below adds the misfortune a network adds -- from a seed, never from
// a clock.
//
// **Single-threaded by contract.** Every endpoint on one `MemoryNetwork` is
// driven from one thread, which is how a test and the two-worlds gate both use
// it. A transport that needed locks to be correct would be testing the locks.
