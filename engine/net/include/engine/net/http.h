// A blocking HTTP/1.1 client (ADR 0012, api-design.md §7 `@std/net.request`).
//
// **Plain `http://` only, and that is a v1 limitation rather than an oversight.**
// TLS needs a TLS library; this repository vendors none. So an `https://` URL is
// REFUSED with a named error rather than silently downgraded to plaintext -- a
// downgrade would send a caller's credentials in the clear on a line of code
// that looks secure, which is the worst of the three available behaviours.
//
// **ADR 0063 says what happens when it IS built**, which this comment used to
// leave open by naming only the obstacle: TLS comes from the PLATFORM -- WinHTTP
// or Schannel, `NSURLSession`, the system OpenSSL -- and not from a vendored
// library. A TLS stack is a maintenance obligation rather than a dependency, it
// is the one where a published CVE obliges a release on somebody else's
// schedule, and the platform's is already patched and already has the trust
// roots. The cost is that THIS client is what gets rewritten: on Windows and
// macOS the TLS and the HTTP are one API, so the honest version is a seam with
// three implementations and the socket code below goes. Worth knowing before
// somebody starts by adding a library, which is the obvious move and not the
// recommended one.
//
// The practical consequence, stated where a caller reads it: `net.request` in v1
// reaches a backend on localhost or on a LAN, which is the shape ADR 0012 says
// v1 is for (a sibling backend process running on Lute). It does not reach the
// public internet.
//
// HTTP/1.1 with `Connection: close` and no keep-alive, no redirects followed, no
// chunked REQUEST bodies. Chunked responses ARE decoded, because a server
// chooses that and a client cannot refuse it.
