// The transport seam (ADR 0012, architecture.md §2 `net_api`).
//
// **This interface is the deliverable; the implementation behind it is not.**
// v1 ships primitives and a loopback echo -- replication is post-v1 (R15) --
// so what M7 owes is a shape future replication can be built on without the
// engine being rebuilt around it. ADR 0012 names GameNetworkingSockets as the
// eventual default with ENet as the LAN option; the manifest row for GNS says
// in full why only ENet is vendored, and the short version is that GNS brings
// protobuf and OpenSSL for a seam with no v1 caller.
//
// **No ENet type appears here** (R17). A caller that can see an `ENetPeer`
// writes code that only works with one transport, which defeats the seam on the
// first line of the first use.
//
// What is deliberately NOT here, so that a later reader does not mistake it for
// an oversight: no replication, no entity ownership, no serialisation, no
// prediction, no clock synchronisation. This moves BYTES between two endpoints,
// with a reliability flag per message. Everything above that is a design nobody
// has approved yet, and a half-built version of it here would be worse than
// none.
