// A blocking TCP client stream with deadlines (architecture.md §2 `net_api`).
//
// Client only. Nothing in v1 listens, and the one caller -- the dev-server
// control connection (ADR 0035) -- dials 127.0.0.1. A listener is what would
// put a port on the developer's machine, which is the thing that decision
// exists to avoid.
//
// No socket type appears in this header. `IDevice` earns its opacity the same
// way (R17): a caller that cannot see a `SOCKET` cannot write code that only
// compiles on one platform.
