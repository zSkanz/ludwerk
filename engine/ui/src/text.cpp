// Text measurement and glyph geometry for the UI (ADR 0011, api-design.md
// §2.2's `TextLabel`).
//
// **The face is a real TrueType one, and `TextLabel.Font` is what chooses it.**
// ADR 0011 named stb_truetype and M7 is where it arrived: the default is Inter
// (OFL 1.1, human decision 2026-08-21), vendored and staged beside the binary,
// and any other name is resolved by the app's content mounts through
// `setFaceProvider`. The property is HONOURED rather than `Inert` -- the
// api-dump carries no `Inert` mark on it, and `measureText` below is where the
// name becomes a face.
//
// **`stb_easy_font` is the FALLBACK, not the face.** A build whose content
// directory has no font still draws text, and a test that runs without staged
// content still measures it; text vanishing because an asset is missing is the
// failure mode a fallback exists to prevent. What it costs, stated so nobody
// has to discover it from a screenshot: ASCII only, one weight, no kerning, and
// a fixed glyph shape that scales by multiplication.
//
// **The glyph store is a CACHE and not a bake, and that is the decision this
// file exists to have made** (human decision, 2026-08-21). An atlas baked once
// at boot works exactly as long as there is one face at one size, and M7 ended
// both halves of that: a project names its own font, and a `TextSize` a tween is
// animating asks for sizes nobody declared. So the store below is keyed by
// **face, size and codepoint** and filled on demand. For the fallback vector
// face the size half of that key is redundant, because the glyph scales by
// multiplication; for a rasterised one it is not, and it was put there a
// milestone before anything needed it.
//
// **Unicode is the same decision from the other side.** The text is decoded as
// UTF-8 into codepoints rather than read a byte at a time, because a game
// written in Portuguese needs á ç ã õ and the fallback face has none of them.
// A codepoint the face in hand cannot draw gets a **visible replacement box**
// rather than nothing, a question mark, or the mojibake that reading the bytes
// one at a time would produce. A player seeing boxes knows the font is missing
// glyphs; a player seeing two strange letters where one accented one should
// be learns nothing.
//
// The seam is `measureText` and `buildTextGeometry`, and it held: the real face
// arrived without moving either signature, the cache's key or its miss path.
// What changed was what fills an entry.
