// The in-game UI: layout, text and the 2D draw list (architecture.md §2 `ui`,
// ADR 0011 as amended by ADR 0040).
//
// Three stages, and they are separate because they run at different times and
// for different reasons:
//
//   1. **Layout** turns the Instance tree into rectangles. It runs only for a
//      `ScreenGui` something marked dirty, which is why every layout-affecting
//      property setter in `native_accessors.cpp` walks up to mark one.
//
//   2. **Text** measures runs and turns them into geometry. Layout needs the
//      measurement (a label that sizes to its text) and drawing needs the
//      geometry, and both come out of one walk over the same face. v1's face is
//      the vector one vendored inside stb, for the reason `text.cpp` states at
//      length: a TrueType face needs a FILE, and shipping one is a licence
//      decision that belongs to a human (R6).
//
//   3. **The draw list** is a flat, ordered array of coloured and textured
//      quads. `render` consumes it; nothing here knows what a GPU is.
//
// **Coordinates are window pixels, y down, origin top-left**, throughout. That
// is the convention every UI system in the world uses and the opposite of the
// world's; the conversion happens once, in the 2D pass's projection.
