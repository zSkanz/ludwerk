// Navigation: where an agent can walk, and how it gets somewhere (ADR 0089).
//
// **A tiled navmesh, built where it is asked for.** A query builds -- or
// rebuilds, if what stands in it changed -- the tiles its two ends span, and a
// path through ground no query has reached comes back partial. Nothing is baked
// offline: the world is data that a script and the editor both change, and an
// asset that goes stale the moment a wall moves is the failure this avoids.
//
// **What is walkable is what is static and solid**: anchored, colliding parts
// under `Workspace`, and `Terrain`'s ground. Recast builds it and Detour
// answers from it, behind this header -- no Recast type appears here (R17).
//
// **Deterministic** (R10): Recast is single-threaded and fed in a fixed order,
// tiles are built in tile order, and every query is a function of the world and
// the queries before it.
