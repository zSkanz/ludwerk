// Asynchronous whole-file reads (architecture.md §2, §10).
//
// Streaming is the caller this exists for: a chunk arriving without a hitch is
// a read that was issued several seconds earlier, at a priority derived from
// how badly the world needs it, and collected at a known point in the frame.
//
// **Priority is ours, not SDL's.** SDL_AsyncIO has a completion queue and no
// notion of priority at all: every task it is handed is equally urgent. So the
// queue that matters is the one here -- requests wait in a priority order this
// module maintains, and only `maxInFlight` of them are handed to SDL at a time.
// That also bounds how much memory in-flight reads can hold, which a service
// with an unbounded submit cannot promise.
//
// **Completions land during `pumpIo()` and nowhere else.** The sketch in
// architecture.md had the callback fire from the IO thread; that would put an
// arbitrary thread and an arbitrary moment between a read and the world, which
// is exactly what R10 forbids for anything the simulation can see. Pumping at
// a FrameStart safe point costs one call per frame and makes "when did this
// land" a question with an answer.
