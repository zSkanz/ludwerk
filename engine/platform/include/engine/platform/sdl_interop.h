// The sanctioned crack in the platform wall.
//
// ADR 0004 keeps SDL inside this module -- with one exception it names, the
// SDL GPU RHI backend, which cannot create a swapchain without the real
// SDL_Window. Architecture.md §2 extends the same allowance to `app`'s glue,
// which is where the ImGui SDL3 backend will be fed.
//
// So rather than pretending otherwise with an opaque handle that the backend
// casts anyway, the access is explicit, named, and confined to a header whose
// filename says what including it means. The public headers next to this one
// stay SDL-free; including THIS one is a declaration that you are one of the
// two modules allowed to know.
