# that the crash handler left behind something a person can act on.
#
# The handler's entire value is in what happens after the process is already
# lost, so this is the only place it can be checked: a doctest case that faulted
# would take the runner down with it, and a case that merely called
# `installCrashHandler` would be asserting that a function returns true.
#
# **Two modes, because they are two different failures**, and one of them had no
# instrument at all until it produced a real defect report nobody could read: a
# person hit a crash, sent the `.dmp`, and there was no debugger on the machine
# to open it with. Where each mode ends up differs by platform and the answer
# came from running this rather than from reading the runtime -- see the note
# above the throw case at the bottom.
#
# **And the note's CONTENT is asserted, not just its existence.** A note that
# exists and says nothing is the same failure wearing a passing gate: the whole
# point is that somebody with no debugger installed can read what broke.
