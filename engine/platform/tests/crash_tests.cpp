// What a crash handler CAN be unit-tested for, which is less than one would
// like: everything interesting about it happens after a fault, and a test that
// faults on purpose takes the test runner with it.
//
// So these cover the half that is testable and is also the half that failed in
// practice: the artifact path is built at INSTALL time, before anything is
// broken. A handler that formatted its path while handling a fault would be
// allocating in a process whose heap is one of the things that might be
// corrupt, and would produce nothing exactly when it is needed.
