// A process that installs the crash handler and then dies on purpose, one of
// two ways.
//
// It exists because the handler's entire value is in what happens *after* a
// fault, and no in-process test can assert on that: a test that faults takes
// the test runner with it. So the assertion is made from outside, by
// `run_crash_gate.cmake`, which runs this and then looks for the artifact.
//
// Without it the handler would be a feature verified by reading it -- which is
// the shape of every "gate that passes while doing nothing" this project has
// found, and would be a particularly bad one here: the failure mode is that a
// human hits the crash the handler was written for and still has nothing to
// send.
