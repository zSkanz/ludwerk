// The 2D physics seam (ADR 0008, post-v1 phase 3).
//
// **A seam of its own, beside `IPhysics3D` and not inside it.** A 2D world is
// not a 3D world with a flat axis: its bodies turn about one angle, its shapes
// are polygons and circles, and its solver is a different library (Box2D, where
// the 3D one is Jolt). One interface for both would be every method taking a
// dimension argument and every backend refusing half of them. What the two
// share is the shape of the contract -- opaque generational handles, a world
// stepped by a fixed tick the caller owns, contacts reported after the step in
// a deterministic order -- and that is kept identical on purpose, so the scene
// mirror for one reads like the mirror for the other.
//
// No Box2D type appears here (R17): the backend has no public header, and is
// reached only through `createBox2DPhysics` in `backends.h`.
