// The 3D physics seam (architecture.md §2, ADR 0007).
//
// One implementation exists in v1 and the interface is still virtual, because
// ADR 0023 makes a backend a build-time selection and architecture.md §2 names
// the second one already: Box3D, when its double precision and cross-platform
// determinism reach 1.0. The seam is also what R17 rests on -- a Jolt type
// cannot reach the Luau bindings if the only physics header those bindings can
// include is this one.
//
// Multi-world by design, and the reason is written down (architecture.md §10):
// a physics world is never a global, so a future dedicated server can run
// several. v1 creates exactly one, and every call still names which.
//
// **Threading.** Every method here is called from the simulation thread and
// from nowhere else. The backend may use worker threads inside `step`; nothing
// it does there is visible until `step` returns, and no callback it makes on a
// worker thread reaches a caller (see `drainContacts`).
