// The whole scheduling surface (api-design.md §3.2). There are no legacy
// globals: no `wait`, no `spawn`, no `delay`, no `tick` (divergence #2, R8).
//
// Two rules shape everything here:
//
//   1. **Timers run on the SimClock, in integer ticks.** `task.wait(1)` is
//      exactly 60 ticks at the default timestep, on every machine and every
//      run -- which is what makes a recorded replay reproduce (ADR 0025). A
//      deadline is a tick index, never a float compared against a float.
//
//   2. **The task-resume phase is one FIFO** ordered by `(deadline tick,
//      scheduling sequence)`, with `task.wait` resumptions and `task.delay`
//      callbacks interleaved. R10 forbids leaving that to container order, so
//      the order is maintained explicitly rather than inherited from a heap.
