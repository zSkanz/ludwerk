// The sandbox R4 actually requires (architecture.md §5, ADR 0020).
//
// `luaL_sandbox` is necessary and nowhere near sufficient. Reading the vendored
// implementation settled what it really does: it freezes the global table one
// level deep and sets the string metatable read-only, and it removes **nothing**
// -- despite a comment of its own that reads as though it does. Every name
// api-design.md §1.1 lists as removed is still sitting in `_G` after it runs.
//
// So the curation is ours, it happens before the freeze, and it is tested from
// C++ rather than from a spec: naming an undeclared global is itself a
// strict-mode error, so a conformance spec cannot legally reference `wait` to
// prove it is absent, and a `:: any` cast around one tests the cast (M2 brief,
// ruling R-D).
