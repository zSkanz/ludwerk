// Deferred-only signals and the one queue they share (api-design.md §3.1,
// ADR 0015).
//
// §3.1 is the contract and it was written before this file existed, on purpose:
// the conformance specs are authored against the document, so the document is
// what this implements rather than the other way round. Four of its rules are
// the ones that shape the data structures here, and each is a decision that
// would be invisible if it were wrong:
//
//   1. **One queue, one order.** Engine fires, script fires and `task.defer`
//      callbacks all enter the same FIFO in raise order. That is what makes the
//      relative order of a script's own `:Fire()` and the `ChildAdded` its
//      `part.Parent = x` caused well defined -- so the queue cannot be per
//      signal, and there is no priority.
//
//   2. **A fire captures the connection list.** Enqueuing records which
//      connections were live at that instant. A connection made afterwards does
//      not run for it, and one disconnected before it is invoked does not run
//      either -- so the snapshot is a list of handles re-validated at invocation
//      rather than a list of functions.
//
//   3. **A drain runs to fixpoint and does not block.** Handlers append to the
//      same queue and the drain continues; a handler that yields is left parked
//      and the drain moves on. So each handler needs its own coroutine, and the
//      loop cannot snapshot the queue's end.
//
//   4. **Re-entrancy is a generation depth, capped at 10.** Every entry carries
//      the depth of whatever raised it. Depths 0 through 10 run, so a
//      self-refiring handler is invoked exactly 11 times. The cap counts
//      everything on the queue, `task.defer` included -- a fires-only cap makes
//      a self-deferring callback a hang rather than a wrong number.
