// §2.2).
//
// **One tag, one metatable, and the class resolved from the id** (M2 brief,
// Decision 13). Luau allows exactly one metatable per userdata tag and refuses
// reassignment, so per-class metatables are not available at any price; and the
// dispatch cache the fast opcodes use lives in the bytecode instruction, which
// makes it per *callsite* and shared by every tag flowing through it. A slot
// numbering that is a pure function of the name is safe there and a per-class
// one mis-dispatches the first time a callsite sees two classes.
//
// So `__index` resolves `InstanceId -> ClassId -> descriptor` and then switches
// on the name atom. The extra indirection lands on a path that already touches
// the component store.
