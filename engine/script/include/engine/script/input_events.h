// `InputService`'s raw event surface: `InputBegan`, `InputChanged`, `InputEnded`
// and the `InputObject` they carry (api-design.md §2.4, ADR 0041).
//
// **These are fed from the Input Action System's dispatch and never from the
// operating system**, which is the whole reason ADR 0041 could amend ADR 0029's
// "only input model" clause. The objection to raw events was never that they
// exist; it was to events read from the OS, which arrive on the wall clock, know
// nothing of what the UI consumed, and cannot be replayed. Coming out of
// `input::InputSystem`'s own tick, all three are answered by machinery that was
// already there.
//
// `script` links `input` already (the `InputAction` method bindings do), so this
// file names `input::RawInputEvent` directly rather than inventing a second POD
// for the same fact.
