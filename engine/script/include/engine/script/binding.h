// The rules every Luau binding in this engine obeys (architecture.md §5).
//
// Grounded in `docs/research/luau-c-api-2026.md`, which was written by reading
// the vendored 0.734 sources rather than by remembering how Luau works. Four of
// the constraints below are not style choices -- they are properties of the VM
// that make a binding either fast or broken, and each cost a reading of
// `third_party/luau` to establish.
//
//   1. **One tag per userdata TYPE, and a tag has exactly one metatable.**
//      `lua_setuserdatametatable` refuses to reassign, so per-class metatables
//      for Instance classes are impossible: there is one `Instance` tag and the
//      class is resolved from the `InstanceId` (M2 brief, Decision 13). Host
//      tags run 0..127 and are shared with every datatype, so they are a budget
//      rather than a namespace -- and tag 0 is what plain `lua_newuserdata`
//      produces, so it is reserved.
//
//   2. **Everything registers before the first script loads.** The fast
//      property-dispatch opcodes are chosen once per `Proto` at `luau_load`,
//      and a deopt is permanent and one-way. A metatable installed after a
//      chunk is loaded is a metatable that chunk will reach only through the
//      slow path, forever.
//
//   3. **The `useratom` callback is installed before `luaL_openlibs`.** It is
//      lazy and one-shot per string, and a string interned before the callback
//      exists latches at -1 for the life of the VM. Installing it late is
//      invisible until a property lookup silently stops using its atom.
//
//   4. **`luaL_sandbox` removes nothing.** It freezes one level deep and only
//      the string metatable, whatever its own comment says. Every removal R4
//      implies -- `getfenv`, `loadstring`, `wait` and the rest -- is ours to
//      perform, before the freeze.
