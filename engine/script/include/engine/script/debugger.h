// Breakpoints, stepping and inspection against the live VM (ADR 0057).
//
// **The VM has had this API since it was vendored and nothing has ever called
// it**: `lua_breakpoint`, `lua_singlestep`, `lua_atbreakpoint` and the
// `lua_Callbacks` hooks `debugbreak`/`debugstep` (`lua.h:555-559`, `:609-612`).
// Scripts are already compiled with `debugLevel = 2` (`modules.cpp:45-47`),
// which is what puts local names and line information in the bytecode. And
// `signals.cpp:507-513` already anticipates the parked state in as many words:
// *"a debugger break, neither error nor yield. Treated like a yield -- the
// thread is still resumable and something else will resume it."*
//
// That something is this, and it has to be. Both resume sites drop their
// bookkeeping BEFORE the resume returns, so nothing else roots a broken
// coroutine -- the hook takes a registry reference and that reference is the
// only thing keeping the parked script alive.
//
// ## A hit breakpoint parks the script, not the engine
//
// The frame loop keeps drawing at sixty frames a second while a coroutine sits
// on `LUA_BREAK`: panels stay live, the camera still flies, and the world is
// inspectable. What stops is the SIMULATION -- `Editor::allowedTicks` answers
// zero while something is parked, which is the same function that already
// refuses ticks to a paused world.
//
// That gate is not a convenience, it is what keeps R10 true. ADR 0025's
// guarantee is indexed by TICKS, and `task.wait` deadlines are tick indices --
// so if ticks ran while a script was parked, the script would resume N ticks
// later than it would have without a debugger attached and the run would
// diverge. No tick begins while parked, so the tick sequence is byte-identical
// to the one without a debugger, and the pause happens between ticks as far as
// the simulation can tell.
//
// ## One call per script, not one per function
//
// `luaG_breakpoint` recurses into every nested proto
// (`VM/src/ldebug.cpp:427-430`), so `lua_breakpoint` on a chunk's top-level
// closure reaches every line in the file -- including inside closures that do
// not exist yet. There is no "the function has not been created" problem, which
// is what would otherwise have been the hardest part of this.
//
// It also answers the line it really landed on (`getnextline`, `:503-537`,
// "the next closest line with valid instructions"), so a marker clicked on a
// comment is drawn where it will actually stop rather than where the click was.
//
// ## What this deliberately does not do
//
// **Write a variable.** `lua_setlocal` is two lines of binding and a divergence
// generator: a value changed from a panel is a world the replay harness can no
// longer reproduce. If it is ever wanted it needs the treatment a hot reload
// gets, not a checkbox.
//
// **Work with native codegen on.** `luaG_breakpoint` skips a proto that has
// `execdata` unless the disable callback is set (`ldebug.cpp:389`), and
// `lua_getlocal` answers null for a native frame (`:84-85`). The engine links
// `Luau.CodeGen` and never calls it, so this holds today -- and whoever turns
// codegen on for speed must read this paragraph first, because stepping will
// stop working silently.
