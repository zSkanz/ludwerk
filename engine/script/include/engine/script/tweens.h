// `TweenService`, `TweenInfo` and `Tween` (api-design.md §2.1, §2.3).
//
// Two decisions shape everything here, and both are in the M6 brief:
//
//   1. **A tween writes through the property setter a script writes through.**
//      Not a second route into the components. That is worth more than the
//      equality filter it preserves (M2 Decision 6, about a third of the
//      10k-parts measurement): a second route would also bypass
//      `GetPropertyChangedSignal`, the physics mirror's change tracking and the
//      range refusals, so a tweened `Size` and an assigned `Size` would MEAN
//      different things.
//
//   2. **A tween steps on the SimClock.** `TweenInfo.Time` is in the same
//      seconds `task.wait` counts, so a tween is a whole number of ticks and a
//      replay reproduces it exactly. The cost is that a tween is as smooth as
//      the tick rate; the alternative is a system whose entire purpose is
//      writing properties reading the wall clock to decide what to write.
//      Rendering already interpolates transforms with `alpha`, so a tween on a
//      `CFrame` is smooth on screen anyway.
//
// A `Tween` is a value type rather than an Instance, like `AnimationTrack`
// (§2.2): nothing parents one and nothing finds one in the tree.
