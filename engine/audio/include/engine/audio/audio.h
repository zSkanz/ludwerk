// **The simulation owns the timeline and the device is downstream.** That is
// the whole design and it is the M6 brief's Decision 9: `Sound.TimePosition`
// advances by `FixedTimestep * PlaybackSpeed` per tick, `Ended` is raised from
// that timeline at a drain, and `AudioSystem::update` pushes the resulting voice
// state to the mixer once per frame, after the tick. If the mixer's position
// were the source of truth, a script reading `TimePosition` would be reading the
// wall clock through a side door (R10) and the same replay would diverge between
// two machines with different buffer sizes.
//
// **What v1 actually makes a sound with.** `Sound.Content` is `Inert` until M7's
// asset pipeline can decode a file, so a voice synthesizes a short enveloped
// tone whose pitch comes from a hash of the content id. It is obviously a
// placeholder and it is deliberately not silence: a silent audio system is one
// nobody can tell is broken, and the mixer, the buses, the distance attenuation
// and the underrun counter are all real and all exercised by it.
//
// **The underrun counter is ours.** The roadmap's gate says "buffer underrun
// counter zero in a 60 s soak", and the string `underrun` appears in miniaudio
// only in comments and ALSA log messages -- there is no counter to read. So this
// module defines one, and defines what it counts: a data callback that found the
// command ring empty of an update it was expecting, plus every command dropped
// because that ring was full. Both are real failure modes of the design above,
// and both are zero in a healthy run.

// samples and the mixer replayed sixteen milliseconds it had already played,
// sixty times a second.

// So the cursor is kept, and the timeline is taken only when the two have
// genuinely parted company -- which is a seek, a rewind, or a sound that was
// stopped and started again. `tolerance` is what "genuinely" means: a drift
// smaller than it is the two clocks being quantised differently, and a drift
// larger than it is somebody having moved one of them.

// which the mixer has wrapped and the timeline has not is not mistaken for a
