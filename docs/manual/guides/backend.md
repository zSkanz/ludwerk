# Talking to a backend

A match between players is the engine's (see [Multiplayer](manual:guides/multiplayer)):
the world replicates and a `RemoteEvent` carries a game's messages. What
outlives a match is not. There is no data store, so a game that needs to
persist something or authenticate somebody talks to **a server you write**,
over HTTP.

That is a smaller promise than a hosted platform makes, and it is a portable
one: the backend is yours, in any language, and it outlives this engine.

## The client

```luau
--!strict
local net = require("@std/net")

local response = net.request({
    url = "http://127.0.0.1:8080/scores",
    method = "POST",
    headers = { ["Content-Type"] = "application/json" },
    body = body,
    timeout = 5,          -- SECONDS, like every other duration here
})
```

`net.request` **yields**. The calling coroutine parks and resumes at a frame
safe point when the answer arrives, so a slow server costs the caller time and
costs the frame nothing.

## Three things that catch people out

**`ok` is about the transport, not the status code.**

```luau
if not response.ok then
    -- never reached a server: refused, timed out, bad host
    warn(response.statusMessage)
elseif response.statusCode >= 400 then
    -- a server answered, and said no
end
```

A 404 is a server answering: `ok` is `true` and `statusCode` is 404.

**It does not raise for a network condition.** A refused connection, a bad URL
and a timeout all come back as a value. It raises only for a malformed *call* —
a missing `url`, a field of the wrong type — because that is a bug in the script
rather than a fact about the world.

**`https://` works, through the platform's own TLS** (ADR 0063): WinHTTP on
Windows, the system's OpenSSL on Linux (`libssl.so.3`, loaded at the first
request), `NSURLSession` on macOS and the Java stack on Android. The
certificate is checked against the device's trust store every time, and there
is no switch that turns the check off -- so a backend needs a certificate from
an authority the operating system trusts, which a free one is. A certificate
that is expired, self-signed or for another name fails with
`net.err.https_untrusted`, and nothing is sent.

Redirects are followed, at most five. A redirect from `https` to `http` is
refused (`net.err.http_redirect_downgrade`), a `303` -- or a `301`/`302`
answering a `POST` -- becomes a `GET` without its body, and `Authorization` and
`Cookie` are not carried to another host.

## Naming

`net.request` returns `statusCode`, not `StatusCode`. The `@std` namespace
exists to be the same surface the tooling runtime exposes, so utility code can
run in both — and a divergence in casing would make the portability the
namespace is *for* into a lie.

Everything else in this engine follows the object/namespace rule; this one
namespace follows its own upstream.

## Where it belongs in a frame

At the **start and the end** of a session, not inside the tick. A tick is 60 Hz
and a database is not.

```luau
--!strict
local RunService = game:GetService("RunService")

-- Right: once, at boot.
task.spawn(function()
    local profile = fetchProfile()
    applyProfile(profile)
end)

-- Wrong: a request per tick.
RunService.Heartbeat:Connect(function()
    postPosition(character.Position)
end)
```

Batch, debounce, and send on a timer — or on a meaningful event, which is
usually better.

## Determinism

A response arrives when a server answers, which is a wall-clock fact. Nothing in
the network module reaches simulation state on its own, but **a script that
writes a response into the world has taken its replay's determinism into its own
hands**.

That is stated rather than prevented, because the alternative is a network API
no backend-talking game could use. Where it matters, apply the response at a
known tick rather than the moment it lands.

## What is not here

- **No server in a script.** `net.serve` is a reserved name. A script never opens
  a port; the only listening socket is the one a match opens with `--host` or
  `--serve` on the command line (ADR 0070).
- **No raw sockets, and no WebSocket client for a script.**
- **No filesystem**, so no local save file. Persistence is the backend.

Players talking to each other is not this page's job: that is
[Multiplayer](manual:guides/multiplayer), with replication, an authority, and
`RemoteEvent` and `RemoteFunction` for your own messages. This page is about the
server you run yourself: scores, accounts, saves.

The `[permissions]` table in `project.toml` parses and is reserved against the day
`serve` and a filesystem arrive; nothing reads it today.

## Sharing code with your backend

The `@std` surface is deliberately the one the Lute tooling runtime exposes, so
a pure module — a scoring rule, a validation, a data shape — can be required by
both your game and a Lute backend without a copy.

That is the reason the namespace exists, and it is what makes "write your own
backend" less work than it sounds.
