# The asset pipeline

Source art lives in the project's content directory. `ludwerk build-assets`
compiles it into a **pack** plus a **manifest**, and the engine mounts both.

```bash
ludwerk build-assets
ludwerk build-assets --verify
```

In development you do not have to run it at all: the loose content directory is
mounted too, and a later mount wins, so an ordinary PNG dropped into
`content/textures/` is picked up with no build step. The pipeline is what a
shipped game gets.

## What is compiled, and to what

| Source | Becomes |
|---|---|
| `.gltf`, `.glb` | The engine's mesh format, with levels of detail |
| `.fbx`, `.obj`, `.dae`, `.ply`, `.stl` | The same, via an offline converter |
| `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.tga`, `.bmp` | The engine's texture container |
| `*.chunk.json` | A compiled chunk, beside the pack, plus a chunk index |
| everything else | Copied through untouched |

**glTF is the canonical format** and stays on its own importer even though the
converter could read it: two importers for one format is two behaviours for one
format.

A font, a JSON file or a shader blob falls into "copied through" and is mounted
as-is.

## Where the output goes

```text
<project>/.engine/content.lpack             the pack
<project>/.engine/content.manifest.json     what is in it
<project>/.engine/content/**.lchunk         compiled chunks
<project>/.engine/content.chunks.json       the chunk index
```

`.engine/` is generated state and is gitignored. Chunks live **outside** the pack
deliberately: a pack is read whole at mount, and a world bigger than memory
cannot have its instance lists resident.

## The manifest

```json
{"format":"content-manifest","version":1,
 "assets":[{"urn":"asset://models/tree.glb","hash":"…","kind":"mesh",
            "bytes":48213,"lods":3,"vertices":1204,"meshlets":11}]}
```

Sorted by URN, with mesh statistics where they apply. It is the file to read
when you want to know why a build is the size it is.

## Determinism

The same inputs produce **byte-identical** output. Four rules make that true:

1. Inputs are sorted by path before anything is processed.
2. Every encoder parameter is pinned in the tool rather than defaulted.
3. No timestamp, absolute path or machine name reaches the output, and a URN
   uses forward slashes on every host.
4. Encoding is single-threaded, because the mesh encoder's format settings are
   process-global.

`--verify` is that guarantee as a flag you can type: it builds twice and
compares. If the two differ, something in the pipeline is not deterministic and
the build fails rather than shipping a lottery.

## What it does not do

**There is no build cache.** Every run compiles everything. For a project the
size of the examples that is a second or two; for a large one it is a reason to
run it deliberately rather than on every save.

There is also no import-settings file: an asset is compiled the one way the
pipeline compiles that kind of asset. Options that would need per-asset settings
— compression choices, LOD counts — are the tool's decisions today.
