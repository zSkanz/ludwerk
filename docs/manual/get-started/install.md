# Install and toolchain

There are two ways to get Ludwerk, and most people want the first one.

## Download it

A release is one archive holding one folder. Unzip it wherever you keep tools,
and everything is inside: the editor, the engine, the command line, the project
template and the type definitions.

```
Ludwerk-1.0.0-win64/
  engine-host.exe           the editor — double-click it
  ludwerk.cmd  ludwerk.ps1     the command line, as you type it
  content/                 what the editor loads beside itself
  player/                  the engine your players get: one per target, for
                           Windows, Linux and Android
  platforms/android/       the template an Android export is assembled from
  tools/  templates/       the command line and what it scaffolds
```

**Double-click `engine-host.exe` and the project browser opens.** It lists what
you have opened before, makes a new project from a template, and starts the
editor on whichever you choose — which is all you need to get from a downloaded
folder to a world you are editing.

The same thing from a terminal, plus everything else the command line does:

```powershell
ludwerk              # nothing to open yet — the browser
ludwerk --version
ludwerk new hello
ludwerk edit hello
```

Put the folder on your `PATH`, or make an alias, and every `ludwerk …` line in
this manual works as written. Nothing else is required to make a game: the
folder finds its own engine, its own template and its own version, wherever you
run it from.

**Windows for now.** The archive carries a Windows editor and a Windows engine,
and `ludwerk build` produces a Windows folder. Linux and macOS are built from
source, below.

**Two commands want a little more.** `ludwerk check` runs the Luau analyzer and
`ludwerk fmt` runs the formatter, and neither is in the archive — they are separate
tools with their own release cadence, and both say so when they are missing:

```
rokit add JohnnyMorganz/luau-lsp
rokit add JohnnyMorganz/StyLua
```

## Build it from source

What you want if you are changing the engine itself, or if you are on Linux or
macOS. There is one bootstrap script, it is idempotent, and it refuses to report
success when a step failed — a bootstrap that lies resurfaces later as a
confusing build error.

### What you need first

| | Windows | Linux / macOS |
|---|---|---|
| A C++20 compiler | Visual Studio 2022 with the C++ workload | Clang |
| CMake and Ninja | Bundled with Visual Studio | From your package manager |
| Git | | |

**On Windows, run everything from a Developer Shell.** The build presets use the
Ninja generator and expect `cl`, `cmake` and `ninja` already on `PATH`. If a
configure step says it cannot find CMake, the fix is almost never to install
CMake — it is to run `VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat` first. The bootstrap
detects this and prints the exact command.

### Bootstrap

```powershell
scripts\bootstrap.ps1
```

```bash
./scripts/bootstrap.sh
```

It does four things:

1. **Sets `ENG_BUILD_ROOT`** — builds are always out of the source tree, and
   the script refuses a value inside the repository.
2. **Checks the native toolchain** and tells you what is missing.
3. **Installs the pinned Luau toolchain** with rokit: `lute`, `luau-lsp` and
   `stylua`, at exactly the versions this engine is tested against.
4. **Generates the Lute type definitions**, without which the analyzer cannot
   resolve a single `@std` require.

Versions are pinned rather than floating. Upgrading one is a deliberate,
reviewed change, not something a fresh checkout does to you.

### Build

```powershell
cmake --preset win-msvc-dev
cmake --build --preset win-msvc-dev
ctest --preset win-msvc-dev
```

> **On Windows, build with `chcp 65001` first.** CMake writes Ninja's dependency
> prefix as UTF-8; a localised compiler emits that string in the console code
> page, the two never match, and Ninja then records **no header dependencies at
> all**. Every incremental build silently reuses objects compiled against an
> older header, and the symptom is a crash in code that has nothing wrong with
> it.

### The CLI from a source tree

`ludwerk` is a wrapper around the pinned Lute runtime rather than a compiled
binary:

```powershell
scripts\ludwerk.ps1 --version
```

```bash
./scripts/ludwerk.sh --version
```

Put the `scripts` directory on your `PATH`, or make an alias, and the rest of
this manual reads the same as it does from a downloaded folder.

### Building the archive

The same folder a release ships, from your own tree:

```powershell
scripts\package.ps1
```

It builds the two profiles a package needs, writes the folder, runs it from
outside the repository to prove it can find its own engine, and only then
compresses it. The order matters: an archive published without that middle step
is one whose first user finds out it cannot.

## Your editor

The project templates ship a VS Code configuration that points `luau-lsp` at the
generated engine definitions, wires the `@shared` alias, and turns the Roblox
platform mode **off**. Two extensions are recommended and both are named in the
template: the Luau language server, and the formatter.

With that in place, `part.Anchorred = true` is a red squiggle rather than a
runtime surprise.

## Check it works

```bash
ludwerk new hello
cd hello
ludwerk dev
```

A window opens. Editing `src/client/Main.luau` and saving rebuilds the world in
well under a second.

## Running the gates

Before you push a change to the engine itself:

```powershell
scripts\localgate.ps1
```

Roughly ninety seconds warm, and it runs everything that can run locally —
documentation checks, the Luau gates, the Windows build and tests, and the Linux
tier in a container. `-Only <stage>` runs one while you iterate.

The Linux stage is not redundant with the Windows one: Clang diagnoses things
MSVC does not, and warnings are errors there.
