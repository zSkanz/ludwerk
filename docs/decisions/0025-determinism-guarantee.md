# 0025 — The precise v1 determinism guarantee

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-08-19

## Context
"Deterministic" is meaningless until scoped. Three levels exist: (A) same-run
repeatability, (B) same-build/same-platform determinism, (C) cross-platform
bit-identical determinism. Level C is a research-grade problem
(floating-point/toolchain/concurrency variance across compilers and CPUs).

## Decision
The **v1 guarantee is level B**:

> Same engine build + same platform + same initial state and seed + same tick
> configuration + same ordered inputs ⇒ same observable simulation result
> (verified by WorldHash).

Level A is implied. **Level C is NOT a v1 guarantee** — cross-platform hash
equality (win↔linux) is measured in a tracked, non-blocking CI job as an
aspiration. Supporting rules: simulation code never reads wall-clock, never
uses unseeded RNG, never iterates unordered containers into observable order
(rule R10); the seed-to-stream mapping of `Random` is itself part of the
guarantee — one seed yields one sequence for any build of the engine on that
platform, because a replay records seeds and not draws, so a stream that
shifted between builds would turn every stored replay into a false failure;
parallel sim-visible work goes through the deterministic commit
pattern (per-job buffers → barrier → stable-order merge → world mutation);
render/asset/IO jobs are exempt. The replay-hash harness exists from M2 and
gates merges from M5.

## Consequences
Tests and terminology stay honest; rollback foundations (ADR 0016) rest on a
guarantee that is actually enforceable in CI.

## Amended 2026-09-23

**The guarantee is level C** ([ADR 0083](0083-the-simulation-is-deterministic-across-platforms.md)):
the research-grade problem above turned out to be four bounded items, and all
four are done. The same seed and operations give the same world hash on every
platform and compiler, and one committed trace per scenario gates every tier.
