# E2 Kickoff — Moving Things

- Started: 2026-08-22
- Roadmap section: docs/roadmap.md#e2--moving-things-l
- Phase: post-v1 phase 1 (the visual editor), milestone 2 of 4

**Read E1's brief before this one**, and its first paragraph in particular. E1
was opened as "the editor opens" and closed as an editor, absorbing most of what
the first cut called E2 — the loop, the content browser, the menu bar, undo, and
a scene format. What is left here is what E1 could not have done first, and
nothing on it was discovered late.

## Goal (restated)

Make the editor a thing you move objects with. Today a transform is changed by
typing a number into the properties grid, one instance at a time, and the only
way to bring an instance into the world is to write `Instance.new` in a script.
By the end of this milestone somebody selects three parts in the viewport, drags
them a metre with a handle, presses ctrl-Z once and gets all three back;
right-clicks in the Explorer and makes a `Part` that appears in front of them;
and drags it onto another instance to reparent it. Nothing more — this is direct
manipulation over the loop E1 built, and every large thing next to it (prefabs,
importers, distributing the editor) belongs to a later milestone.

## Scope checklist (from roadmap)

- [x] Translate, rotate and scale manipulators in the viewport, world and local space
- [x] Snapping, with a modifier to suspend it
- [x] Multi-select: ctrl-click and shift-range in the Explorer, ctrl-click in the viewport
- [x] **Properties over a multi-selection: common properties, and a mixed value
      marked as mixed** — the intersection is by name AND by type, and a property
      read-only on any member is read-only for the set
- [x] Creating an instance from the Explorer's per-row plus and its class menu
- [x] **Reparenting by drag in the Explorer** — the row is both source and
      target, and the target lights up only where the drop would move something:
      `planReparent` is asked by the verb and by the drop, so the highlight
      cannot promise what the move then refuses. Dropping BETWEEN rows is not
      built and is not this: sibling order is parenting order, and reordering is
      a `World` verb that does not exist
- [x] Batch delete and duplicate, one undo step each, acting on the selection
- [x] The gesture-based undo key, extracted out of `engine.cpp` and tested
- [x] `worldToViewport` in `picking.h`, as the exact inverse of `rayThroughPixel`
- [x] The gizmo and the selection outline submitted camera-relative — and the
      outline became a SILHOUETTE rather than a box, which was asked for at review
      and is beyond the scope this milestone opened with
- [x] An `authorable` predicate covering engine-owned, `generated`, and the ancestors of both

### The four interfaces, frozen (subagent plan)

All four are built, tested and green, which is the point the plan said nothing
fans out before:

1. **The selection is a set** owned by the `Inspector`, primary = last clicked,
   with `pruneDead` replacing four hand-written liveness checks.
2. **An edit is a gesture**, and `coalesceKeyFor` owns the undo key that used to
   be four untested lines in `engine.cpp`.
3. **The manipulator arithmetic**: `worldToViewport`, `metresPerPixel`,
   `pickGizmo`, `gizmoDragPoint`, `gizmoDragAngle` — nine cases in
   `picking_tests.cpp`, including the near-parallel axis, the off-axis grab and
   four kilometres from the origin.
4. **`Editor`**: `createInstance`, `reparent`, `deleteInstances`,
   `duplicateInstances`, `authorable`.

### What arrived out of order, and it is most of a session

Recorded because the roadmap's own protocol says scope that arrives after a
kickoff is annotated rather than absorbed silently.

- **Creating an instance came first**, not last: a person asked for the plus
  before the manipulators, and it is E2 scope arriving early rather than new
  scope.
- **Seven defects**, six of them from somebody using the thing: D067 (a boot
  scene destroying the world the scripts built), D068 (Save Scene As writing into
  `content/content/`), D069 (the game's pointer lock leaking the mouse into the
  panels), D070 (the capsule flickering after a stop), D071 (ctrl-Z collapsing
  the explorer), D072 (an unbalanced `PopStyleColor`), and D066 quarantined at its
  second flake.
- **The icon set was wired**, which was not in this brief at all: staging,
  `IconAtlas`, a generated id header with a freshness gate, and the Explorer,
  content browser and toolbar drawing from it.
- **The Explorer's rows were rebuilt** around one row height, after three reports
  that were one mistake — see D071's neighbours in the register.

## NOT in scope

Prefabs and nested scenes (E3). An asset importer (E3). Distributing the editor
(E4). Shape-exact picking. Solid gizmo geometry — `DebugDraw` is a line list and
stays one. A second viewport, an orthographic view, view bookmarks. Align and
distribute. Copy and paste. A dedicated transform panel. Scripting the editor.
And the Luau VM that a stop does not put back, which is still E1's honest limit.

## What four reconnaissance passes found, before a line was written

Five passes sized E1 (ADR 0046); four sized this one, and they are the reason
the roadmap section has six decisions in it rather than a task list.

**The foundations are there and they are tested.** `rayThroughPixel` reads its
two tangents back off the projection matrix the frame was rendered with, so a
gizmo built on it cannot disagree with the image. `DebugDraw` draws in a pass
with no depth attachment, so it is already over everything. `World::setParent`
already returns a typed error and already refuses `newParent == id` and
`isAncestorOf(id, newParent)`. `World::clone` already rewires references that
point inside the copied subtree. ImGui 1.92.9b-docking has drag-and-drop and
`BeginMultiSelect` compiled in.

**Three things are broken today and only building on them would have found it.**

1. **The undo coalescing key cannot survive a manipulator.** It is computed in
   `engine.cpp` as `(target << 32) | property`, and only when the frame has
   exactly one pending write — two or more give zero, and zero never coalesces.
   A gizmo writes `CFrame` and `Size` together, or writes to three selected
   parts, on the first frame of the first drag. Nothing tests the calculation:
   `editor_tests.cpp` drives `record` directly and never sees it.
2. **The selection outline shakes far from the origin, and nobody has reported
   it.** `submitSelection` submits in world coordinates and `DebugDraw::rebaseTo`
   subtracts in f32, so the absolute metre value is quantised before the camera
   is taken off it. Half a millimetre at four kilometres, worse beyond. A gizmo
   built the same way inherits it onto a handle somebody is dragging precisely.
3. **`isEngineOwned` does not know about `generated`.** Drop an authored part
   inside a streamed chunk's folder and the scene format skips it — the
   serializer skips a generated subtree whole — and the next eviction destroys
   it silently. Nothing stops that today; nothing has tried.

**And one absence worth naming**: there is no world-to-screen projection anywhere
in the repository. `worldToViewport` is new, and it belongs beside
`rayThroughPixel` and tested by round-trip against it.

## Subagent plan

The interfaces freeze first, in this order, and every one of them is orchestrator
work because each touches two modules' seams:

1. `Inspector`'s selection set and `pruneDead` — everything else reads it.
2. The gesture, and the extracted coalescing key.
3. `picking.h`: `worldToViewport`, the gizmo frame, the axis hit test, the drag
   solve. Pure functions, no ImGui, no `World`.
4. `Editor`: `createInstance`, `reparent`, the batch forms, and `authorable`.

Fanned out only after those headers compile:

- **Test authors** — `picking_tests.cpp` cases from the gate wording alone, not
  from the implementation. The corner and near-parallel cases are the ones that
  matter and they are stated in the gate for that reason.
- **An adversarial reviewer** on the diff, briefed at R10 (a gizmo must not reach
  simulation state), R3 (the editor draws literals; ADR 0046 §"R3 does not apply"
  — but a *game*'s strings still obey it), R17, and the f64/f32 boundary, citing
  rule numbers.
- **A research verifier** for the ImGui multi-select-with-clipper contract, which
  needs the `RangeSrcItem` seek and which `drawExplorer`'s clipper loop has none
  of. Answers quoted from `third_party/imgui`, file and line.

Not fanned out: the selection refactor, the undo change, and anything that
touches `engine.cpp`'s frame loop.

## Gate checklist (verbatim from roadmap)

- [ ] `luaug edit examples/06-scene` opens, a part is selected, and each of the three
      manipulators moves it in the viewport. A screenshot per mode is attached to the
      gate record.
- [x] **The manipulator arithmetic has unit tests over a camera and a viewport
      rectangle**, covering: an axis handle hit at the centre of the screen and at a
      corner; an axis nearly parallel to the view direction; a drag that begins off
      the axis; a non-square viewport; and a round trip — `worldToViewport` of a
      point, back through `rayThroughPixel`, aiming at that point — checked at the
      four corners, because that is the aspect-ratio error the file already exists to
      catch.
- [x] **One drag is one undo step**, proven headlessly: sixty frames of writes inside
      one gesture produce one history entry, and two gestures over the same property
      produce two. The extracted key has its own test; the inline calculation it
      replaces had none.
- [x] **A transform over a multi-selection moves each instance by the same delta**,
      proven on a selection whose members start at different transforms: three parts
      a metre apart are still a metre apart after the drag.
- [x] **The gizmo does not shake four kilometres from the origin.** The vertices
      `DebugDraw` holds for a gizmo submitted at 4 km agree with the exact
      camera-relative value to within a tenth of a millimetre. The same check covers
      the selection outline, which is the defect it finds.
- [x] Multi-select in the Explorer and in the viewport; the Properties panel shows
      the common properties of a mixed-class selection and marks a differing value as
      mixed. Proven by tests over the free functions that compute both, since the
      panel itself cannot be driven headlessly.
- [x] Creating an instance from the UI lands under the parent the menu was opened on,
      is selected, and is taken back by one undo. Reparenting by drag moves a
      subtree, refuses a cycle, and refuses a target inside a streamed chunk — all of
      it driven through `Editor` directly by a test rather than by a mouse.
- [x] Deleting a selection of four is one undo step, and undoing it brings all four
      back with the same instance ids, which is the property E1's delete test already
      asserts for one.
- [x] `scripts/localgate.ps1` green on every stage; `luaug check` clean; docs-lint
      clean.
- [ ] **A human opens the editor on the flagship, moves something, and says whether
      it moves the way a manipulator should** — deliberately not automatable, and the
      gate item every milestone since M4 has proven is where the real defects come
      from.

## Where E2 stands, 2026-08-23

Written at the human's request, from `git log` and the register rather than from
memory. Seventeen commits since the kickoff, every one of them behind a green
six-stage local gate.

### Built

**The four interfaces the subagent plan said nothing fans out before**, all
tested:

1. **The selection is a SET**, owned by the `Inspector`, primary = last clicked,
   with `pruneDead` replacing four hand-written liveness checks — and closing a
   latent defect none of them could see: select a child, delete its parent, and
   the selection pointed at a retired instance.
2. **An edit is a GESTURE.** The undo key left `engine.cpp` for `coalesceKeyFor`,
   which no test could reach before. One drag is one step however many writes it
   made; without a gesture the old rule still applies, so nothing that has not
   opted in changed.
3. **The manipulator arithmetic**: `worldToViewport` (the inverse this repository
   never had), `metresPerPixel`, `pickGizmo`, `gizmoDragPoint`, `gizmoDragAngle`
   — nine cases, including the near-parallel axis, the off-axis grab, a non-square
   viewport and four kilometres from the origin.
4. **`Editor`**: `createInstance`, `reparent`, `deleteInstances`,
   `duplicateInstances`, `authorable`.

**The manipulators themselves.** Translate, rotate and scale; world axes or the
selection's own; a grid with a modifier that suspends it; W E R to switch. Drawn
in lines through `DebugDraw` and camera-relative, so they do not shake four
kilometres out — which is a test. The manipulator takes the pointer before the
picker does, so grabbing a handle does not select what is behind it.

**Multi-select**, in the Explorer (ctrl-click, shift-range) and in the viewport
(ctrl-click). Delete and duplicate act on the selection, one undo step each,
ordered by the tree so the same selection is the same result.

**Creating an instance**, from a plus at the end of every Explorer row, over the
twenty-seven classes `Instance.new` accepts — read from the same three flags, so
a class tagged `NotCreatable` tomorrow leaves the menu with no edit here. New
parts land in front of the editor camera rather than at the origin.

**The selection outline became a SILHOUETTE** rather than a box: a mask and a
dilate, which is how the effect it was compared to works. Asked for at review and
beyond the scope this milestone opened with.

**The icon set is wired** — staging, `IconAtlas`, a generated id header with a
freshness gate, the Explorer, the content browser and the toolbar drawing from
it, and tinting by role with a switch that turns it off. Not in this brief at
all; it arrived because the icons did.

**A script is a file, and the editor writes it** (ADR 0048), because "why can I
not add a script" had an answer that was correct and useless.

**The flagship's world is a file** (D074): `examples/10-open-world` is
scene-first, `luaug-host --save-scene` is the migration that made it possible,
and `@luaug/camera` adopts a camera the scene already holds.

**The properties grid answers for the SELECTION.** The rows are the properties
every member has — intersected by name AND by type, because two classes that
declare one name for two types cannot share a widget — and an edit writes to all
of them. A property read-only on any member is read-only for the set. Where the
members disagree, each widget says so in the way it can (an indeterminate
checkbox, a drag that hides its number, a text field that starts empty) and the
label carries a `(mixed)` tag for the two that cannot.

**And a row is a drag source and a drop target.** `Editor::reparent` had been
built and tested for a week with nothing able to reach it. The rule is now
`planReparent`, asked by the verb AND by the drop target a frame before the drag
ends — so a row lights up only where the drop would move something, rather than
lighting up and then refusing.

### Not built

- **Dropping BETWEEN rows**, which is reordering rather than reparenting: sibling
  order is parenting order, and a `World` verb that moves a child within its
  parent does not exist. Out of this milestone rather than left undone.
- **The scene-first migration for every other example.** Only the flagship moved.
- **The Gate Record**, the screenshots, and the human's sign-off.

### Nine defects, seven of them found by a person using the thing

D067 (a boot scene destroying the world the scripts built), D068 (Save Scene As
writing into `content/content/`), D069 (the game's pointer lock leaking the mouse
into the panels), D070 (the capsule flickering after a stop), D071 (ctrl-Z
collapsing the explorer), D072 (an unbalanced `PopStyleColor`), D073 (selection
emptying the frame — mine, one commit old), D074 (two of everything after a
save). D066 was quarantined at its second flake.

**Three of those are the same shape and it is worth naming**: D070, D071 and D073
are each a piece of arithmetic or a rule that is right for one and wrong for many
— one instance, one world, one draw. This milestone's whole subject is "many", so
it found them.

## Attempted / abandoned

_(appended during the milestone; MASTER_PROMPT.md §12)_

## Gate Record

**Every item below is answered except the two that need a person at a window,
and those are marked PENDING rather than argued around.** The limit is stated in
`PROGRESS.md` and in E1's brief and has not changed: the ImGui shell cannot
render headlessly and SDL does not accept injected input, so there is no
automated path to a picture of this editor or to a click inside it.

Closing run, 2026-08-23, on the reference machine.

### Item by item

| Gate item | Answer |
|---|---|
| `luaug edit examples/06-scene` opens, a part is selected, each manipulator moves it, a screenshot per mode | **PENDING — a human at a window.** Everything the picture would show is asserted below; what the picture adds is whether it *feels* right, which is the next row. |
| The manipulator arithmetic has unit tests over a camera and a viewport rectangle | **Pass.** `picking_tests.cpp`, seven cases for the manipulator on top of the ray ones: `worldToViewport is the exact inverse of rayThroughPixel, at the corners too`, `a point behind the camera has no place on the screen`, `a manipulator is the same size on screen however far away it is`, `a click on an arm picks that arm, and one on the middle picks the middle`, `an arm pointing at the camera is refused rather than divided by`, `a drag along an arm reports a point on that arm, and the delta is the drag`, `a plane handle drags in its own plane and never out of it`, `a rotate ring is picked at its radius and reports the angle round it`, `a manipulator four kilometres out is picked exactly as one at arm's length`. The round trip is checked at the four corners, which is the aspect-ratio error the file exists to catch. |
| One drag is one undo step, proven headlessly | **Pass.** `editor_tests.cpp: one drag is one undo step, however many frames it lasts` drives sixty frames of writes inside one gesture; `a drag on one property is one step, and two properties are two` covers the ungestured fallback. The key itself is tested in `inspector_tests.cpp` through `coalesceKeyFor`, which nothing could reach while it was inline in `engine.cpp`. |
| A transform over a multi-selection moves each instance by the same delta | **Pass.** `editor_tests.cpp: a drag over a multi-selection moves each instance by the same delta` — three parts a metre apart, still a metre apart after the drag. |
| The gizmo does not shake four kilometres from the origin | **Pass.** `editor_tests.cpp: a manipulator four kilometres out is submitted where it is, not where a float can reach`, against the vertices `DebugDraw` actually holds. The same defect in the selection outline is what the check was written for, and it is fixed. |
| Multi-select in the Explorer and the viewport; the Properties panel shows the common properties of a mixed-class selection and marks a differing value as mixed | **Pass**, through the free functions, since the panel cannot be driven headlessly. `inspector_tests.cpp`: seven cases over `collectCommonProperties` and `sharedValue` — one class however many are in it, a base and a derived, a name declared with two TYPES dropped, a property read-only on any member read-only for the set, a dead member skipped, `Same`/`Mixed`/`Unreadable`, and two NaNs not counting as a disagreement. The drawing half runs for real on a device: `debug_overlay_tests.cpp` renders the panel over a selection of two that disagree about every property, and over one spanning two unrelated classes. |
| Creating an instance from the UI lands under the parent the menu was opened on, is selected, and is taken back by one undo | **Pass.** `editor_tests.cpp: creating lands under the parent that was asked, is selected, and one undo takes it back` — with something else selected first, because the claim is only worth testing when the selection disagrees with the parent. It also asserts the create is ONE history step rather than two, and that a refused class records none. |
| Reparenting by drag moves a subtree, refuses a cycle, and refuses a target inside a streamed chunk | **Pass.** `reparenting moves a subtree, refuses a cycle, and never records a step that does nothing`, `nothing authored may live inside what a system made`, `nothing can be created inside a chunk, including inside what the chunk holds` (D077 — the chunk's own row was refused and everything under it was not), and `a drop target lights up for exactly the drops that would move something`, which is the rule the Explorer's drop target previews through the same function the verb applies. |
| Deleting a selection of four is one undo step, and undoing it brings all four back with the same ids | **Pass.** `a batch delete is one undo step, and undoing it brings back the same ids`, plus `a batch is ordered by the tree, so the same selection is the same result` and `deleting a parent and its child together is not an error`. |
| `scripts/localgate.ps1` green on every stage; `luaug check` clean; docs-lint clean | **Pass**, above. |
| A human opens the editor on the flagship, moves something, and says whether it moves the way a manipulator should | **PENDING — and it is the item this milestone was most shaped by.** Nine of E2's twelve defects arrived this way while the milestone was still open. |

### What the record should not be read as saying

**Twelve defects closed, ten of them found by a person using the editor**, and
the two the tests found were both mine, one commit old. That ratio is not a
complaint about the tests: everything above is a claim about what the editor
DECIDES, and nine of the twelve were about what it does — a pointer that leaked
into a panel, a capsule that flickered, a tree that collapsed on ctrl-Z, a plus
on a row nothing could be created under.

**Three of them are one shape and it is the finding worth carrying**: D070, D071
and D073 are each a piece of arithmetic or a rule that is right for ONE and wrong
for many — one world's transform history, one selection, one draw inside a batch.
None was wrong when it was written. A milestone whose whole subject is "many" is
what asks the larger question, and this one asked it three times.

**And D073 is the one to carry furthest.** I solved a TOOL's problem inside
`buildInstanceBatches`, which every pass of the frame depends on, and it took
every boulder and every tree canopy out of the flagship the instant anything was
selected. The cost of a tool belongs in the tool's pass.
