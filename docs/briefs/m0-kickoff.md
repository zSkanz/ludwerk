# M0 Kickoff — Bootstrap and First Light

- Started: 2026-08-19
- Roadmap section: [`docs/roadmap.md`](../roadmap.md) § "M0 — Bootstrap and First Light (S)"

## Goal (restated)

Turn a docs-only repository into a repository that *builds and proves things*.
By the end of M0 there is a real, pinned, hermetic dependency tree under
`third_party/`; a CMake superbuild that produces `luaug-host` out-of-tree; and
that host creates a sandboxed Luau 0.734 VM, runs `boot.luau`, and prints a
greeting that was never written as a literal string in C++ — it came out of the
i18n catalog through a `TextKey`. Nothing renders, nothing simulates. What M0
buys is the *spine*: pinning, layering, sandboxing, the i18n seam, the error
pipeline, the test harness, and CI on two tiers. Every later milestone hangs
off these, so the bar here is correctness of the seams, not quantity of code.

The grounding proof matters as much as the greeting: `--version` must report
the Luau version by reading the **vendored header**, not a string we typed. That
single test is what makes "pinned" mean something.

## Scope checklist (from roadmap)

- [x] Vendor third-party dependencies into `third_party/` at manifest-target
      versions, recording **real commit SHAs** (Luau, SDL3, doctest first;
      later deps may be vendored lazily but manifest rows must exist)
- [x] Activate `CMakePresets.json` (build dirs under `$env{LUAUG_BUILD_ROOT}`,
      never in-tree)
- [x] `luaug-host` executable: create Luau VM, `luaL_sandbox`, register a
      minimal `print`/log bridge routed through the key+catalog i18n system
      (one English catalog proves the seam)
- [x] rokit-pinned toolchain (Lute 1.0.0, StyLua 2.5.2, luau-lsp 1.69.0)
- [x] Activate CI: Windows + Linux build, ctest, `luau-analyze` strict on all
      `.luau`, StyLua check, i18n lint stub, docs-lint

**Deliverable:** `luaug-host boot.luau` prints a catalog-resolved greeting and
exits 0 on Windows and Linux.

## NOT in scope

Explicitly deferred — if any of these start to feel necessary, that is a signal
to stop and re-read the roadmap, not to widen M0:

- **No window, no SDL init, no rendering, no RHI.** SDL3 is *vendored and
  compiled* in M0 only if it is free to do so; `platform` and `rhi_*` modules
  are M1. If wiring SDL3 into the build costs more than trivial effort, the
  manifest row + vendored tree is the whole M0 obligation and the CMake target
  waits for M1.
- No ECS, no Instance, no `game`/`workspace`, no services, no signals, no
  `task` — that is all M2. `boot.luau` sees `print` and the Luau stdlib.
- No `require`/Luau.Require wiring, no `@std`, no `@luaug` modules (M2/M3).
- No `luaug` CLI, no hot reload, no dev server, no templates (M3).
- No `api/` IDL, no generated defs, no api-dump (M2/M3).
- No jobs system, no scheduler, no fixed tick, no determinism harness (M2).
- No native codegen (`Luau.CodeGen`) enablement work beyond linking what the
  build needs; NCG tuning is a later, benchmark-driven exercise.
- No `.luauc` bytecode cache, no shipping/bytecode-only profile.
- No memory categories beyond whatever the log/error path trivially needs;
  the 256-memcat plan (architecture §5) is M2 work.
- No new ADRs unless implementation genuinely contradicts an existing one.

## Subagent plan

**None. M0 is orchestrator-only, single-threaded.**

This is the correct call under MASTER_PROMPT §7, which explicitly excludes
fan-out for cross-cutting work, build-system work, and gate runs — and M0 is
*entirely* those three. There are no frozen module interfaces to hand out yet
(freezing them is what M0 does), so parallel implementation agents would be
inventing the seams they are supposed to be implementing against. The
adversarial-review pass at the end of the milestone is performed by the
orchestrator against the rule list (R1–R17) as part of the gate run.

## Gate checklist (verbatim from roadmap)

- [x] CI green on Tier-1/Tier-2
- [x] `ctest` includes at least: VM boots sandboxed (env mutation from script
      fails)
- [x] `ctest` includes at least: script error surfaces as a structured engine
      error with an i18n key
- [x] `--version` prints the engine version, the pinned Luau version **and
      commit SHA** (generated at configure time from
      `third_party/manifest.json`, never typed into source), and the Luau ABI
      constants **read from the vendored headers** (`LBC_VERSION_TARGET`,
      `LBC_TYPE_VERSION_TARGET`, `LUA_VECTOR_SIZE`, `LUA_VECTOR_DOUBLE`), with
      a test asserting the latter match ADR 0013 — the grounding proof

> Gate item 4 was amended by [ADR 0031](../decisions/0031-build-provenance-header.md)
> after the original wording proved unsatisfiable: Luau 0.734 ships no version
> constant in any header. Escalated and approved by the human per
> `MASTER_PROMPT.md` §10 before any code was written against it.

## Environment findings (dev machine, 2026-08-19)

Recorded because M0 is the milestone that makes the machine buildable, and the
starting state was not.

| Tool | State | Action |
|---|---|---|
| MSVC 14.50.35717 (VS 18 Community) | present | meets the C++20 baseline (architecture §8) |
| Windows SDK 10.0.26100.0 | present | ok |
| CMake | **not on PATH** | VS-bundled copy exists; must be resolved before configure |
| Ninja | **not on PATH** | VS-bundled copy exists; the presets require it |
| rokit | **absent** | required by `scripts/bootstrap.ps1`; installs the pinned trio |
| Lute / StyLua / luau-lsp | **absent** | installed by `rokit install` from `rokit.toml` |
| `pwsh` (PowerShell 7) | **absent** (5.1 present) | `CLAUDE.md` invokes `pwsh scripts/bootstrap.ps1` |
| Network | available | vendoring by `git clone` is viable |

## Pins captured (real SHAs, resolved 2026-08-19)

Resolved by `git ls-remote` against upstream, not from memory or the reports:

| Dependency | Tag | Commit |
|---|---|---|
| luau | `0.734` | `3fc82b1071ab387531175869afc4fb528464afa4` |
| sdl3 | `release-3.4.14` | `147a8ee32dbf9ac02f3794964490687b6bbda1bc` |
| doctest | `v2.5.3` | `2d0a9359a60c51affe2a9bebb1be1dca47868151` |

This resolves **U-07** (SDL 3.4.x exact patch version — the reports conflicted
between 3.4.8 and 3.4.14; upstream `releases/latest` says 3.4.14, published
2026-08-03). `docs/research/UNCONFIRMED.md` is updated in the same commit as
the manifest.

## Findings (things the docs assumed that reality corrected)

Recorded because each one cost real time and will cost it again otherwise.

1. **Luau 0.734 ships no version constant.** No `LUAU_VERSION`/`LUA_VERSION`
   macro, no `project(... VERSION ...)`, no `VERSION` file; the string `0.734`
   appears nowhere in the tree. Version exists only as a git tag. → ADR 0031.
2. **Lute 1.0.0's own generated typedefs do not typecheck** under the pinned
   luau-lsp 1.69.0 (`@std/path`, `@lute/time`, `@std/fs`, `@std/json` all emit
   errors). CI must pass `--ignore="**/.lute/**"` or it fails for upstream
   reasons. Also `--platform=standard`, or luau-lsp tries to load Roblox defs.
3. **`fs.walk` cannot be driven by a generic `for`** on Lute 1.0.0: its
   iterator makes a yielding libuv call, giving "attempt to yield across
   metamethod/C-call boundary". Use `fs.listDirectory` and walk explicitly.
   (`fs.watch` documents the same constraint — it is a general Lute pattern.)
4. **`@std/json` tags decoded objects with a `newproxy()` sentinel key**, so
   iterating a decoded object yields a userdata among the string keys.
5. **Lute passes the script path as `process.args[1]`**; user arguments start
   at index 2.
6. **`rokit install` aborts on an interactive trust prompt.** `--no-trust-check`
   is required for CI and for any non-interactive session.
7. **Visual Studio bundles CMake and Ninja**; the presets' real requirement is
   the Developer Shell (`strategy: external`), not a separate CMake install.
8. **CMake's regex engine has no bounded repetition** — `{40}` silently fails
   to match, so a SHA length check must be a separate `string(LENGTH ...)`.
9. **Luau builds `Luau.Analysis` unconditionally** even with CLI and tests off.
   We never link it; it is roughly a third of a clean build. Worth trimming in
   a later milestone, not worth a vendored patch now (ADR 0021).
10. **`luaL_openlibs` leaves `getfenv`, `setfenv` and `newproxy` in the global
    table, and points `_G` at the real environment** — all four contradict
    `api-design.md` §1.1. Found by running the built host and probing, not by
    reading code. This is not cosmetic: `getfenv`/`setfenv` disable the
    `safeenv` optimization, which is simultaneously the sandbox guarantee (R4)
    and the import fastpath, and native codegen gives up on any function that
    touches them (`docs/research/luau-2026.md` §3). Left in place it would have
    quietly invalidated every performance number measured afterwards. Fixed in
    `ScriptHost` before `luaL_sandbox`, with tests.

    *Scope note:* global curation nominally belongs to M2 (`architecture.md`
    §5 installs `game`/`workspace` in the same place). It was pulled forward
    deliberately because it is a sandbox-correctness issue against a spec that
    already exists, not new feature work — and because every measurement taken
    before the fix would have been misleading.
11. **Passing analyzer inputs as an expanded file list does not scale on
    Windows.** Measured: ~400 paths overflow the 32,767-character command-line
    limit and `luau-lsp` fails to launch. Harmless in CI (the `luau-check` job
    runs on Linux, where `ARG_MAX` is ~2 MB) but it will bite `luaug check` in
    M3, which must work on Windows. Passing a **directory** avoids it entirely,
    and `luau-lsp analyze` does recurse — verified with a planted error in file
    7 of 400.

12. **A Windows console on a legacy OEM codepage mangles the catalogs.** The
    engine emits UTF-8 (ADR 0019); a `cmd` window on CP-850 decodes the em dash
    in `engine.boot.hello` as `ÔÇö`. Reported by the human running the binary in
    a real console — it is invisible through a pipe, which is why neither CI nor
    any tooling here caught it. Left unfixed it would have made
    "adding a locale is adding a file" false on Windows for any language with
    accents, which is most of them. Fixed with a scoped
    `SetConsoleOutputCP(CP_UTF8)` that restores the previous codepage on exit,
    since the codepage belongs to the console rather than the process.

    *Verification:* this cannot be confirmed from the agent's environment,
    which has no interactive console — `GetConsoleOutputCP` returns 0 there and
    the guard correctly no-ops (proven by temporarily disabling the restore and
    observing the codepage never change). **Confirmed fixed by the human in a
    real console, 2026-08-19.** A fully robust fix (`WriteConsoleW` with wide
    strings when stdout is a console) belongs to `platform` in M1.

    The general lesson, worth more than the bug: this class of defect is
    invisible through a pipe, so no CI job and no agent-run check can catch it.
    Only running the thing for real does. It is the observation rule
    (`MASTER_PROMPT.md` §8) arriving early, before there is any rendering to
    screenshot.

## Measured: how analysis scales with .luau count

Taken on the dev machine so M3's `luaug check` has a baseline to start from.
Synthetic `--!strict` modules with generics, unions and refinements, analyzed
via the directory form, second run of two:

| files | wall time | ms per file |
|---|---|---|
| 25 | 73 ms | 2.92 |
| 100 | 105 ms | 1.05 |
| 400 | 236 ms | 0.59 |

Sublinear: roughly 60 ms fixed startup plus ~0.45 ms marginal per file.
Extrapolated, 10,000 files is still only a few seconds — analysis is nowhere
near being the bottleneck next to an ~8-minute cold C++ build.

Two caveats this measurement does **not** cover: the modules are independent,
with no `require` between them, so cross-module generic inference (the
expensive case) is untested; and the known new-solver failure mode is **memory
on large script counts**, not wall time (`docs/research/luau-2026.md` §2,
ADR 0018) — that is what to watch, and it needs a realistic dependency graph
to provoke.

## Attempted / abandoned

- **Patching Luau to add a version header** — considered to satisfy the
  original gate wording literally, rejected in ADR 0031: a permanent rebase
  burden in the fastest-moving dependency, against ADR 0021's near-empty patch
  set. The gate was amended instead, with human approval.
- **`json.serialize` to write back `manifest.json`** — rejected. `@std/json`
  emits keys in `pairs` order and renders an empty table as `[]`, so a
  round-trip would scramble a hand-authored, human-reviewed file. `vendor.luau`
  therefore never writes the manifest at all, which is also the right
  authority split (R5).

### CI, both tiers

Remote created by the human at `github.com/zSkanz/luaug` (private) during the
session; the two blockers recorded earlier in this brief are therefore closed.

Run `32235932775` (and re-confirmed on every subsequent push):

| Job | Result |
|---|---|
| `docs-lint` | success |
| `luau-check` | success |
| `build-test (windows-latest, win-msvc-dev)` | success |
| `build-test (ubuntu-latest, linux-clang-dev)` | success |

Tier-2 detail, since it had never been compiled before today and was expected
to fail — the Linux profile adds `-Wconversion -Wsign-conversion
-Wold-style-cast -Wshadow -Wpedantic` under `-Werror`:

```
ninja already present: 1.13.2
-- LuauG: Luau 0.734 @ 3fc82b1071ab387531175869afc4fb528464afa4
-- Configuring done (5.0s)
[231/231] Linking CXX executable engine/app/luaug_app_tests
100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 6
```

It compiled clean on the first real attempt, with no warnings.

Timings (cold, no cache — `sccache` per architecture.md §9 is not built yet):
Windows `build-test` 8 min 26 s end to end, of which 7 min 59 s is compiling
(231 targets, mostly Luau itself) and 0.17 s is the tests. `docs-lint` 8 s,
`luau-check` 10 s.

### Gate result

**All five gate items met.** M0 is complete and awaiting human sign-off, which
is the milestone checkpoint (`MASTER_PROMPT.md` §6) and the one thing this
session cannot do for itself.
