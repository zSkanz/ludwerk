# E1 Kickoff — The Editor Opens

- Started: 2026-08-22
- Roadmap section: docs/roadmap.md#e1--the-editor-opens-m
- Phase: post-v1 phase 1 (the visual editor), opened by human decision 2026-08-22

## Goal (restated)

Make an editor that opens a real project, draws it, lets a mouse choose
something in it, and lets that something be changed — and stop there. Not
because the rest is unimportant but because manipulators, undo and saving are
each large enough to deserve a milestone, and none of them can be designed
honestly by somebody who has not yet used the selection they all stand on. The
end of this milestone is a person clicking a tower in `examples/10-open-world`
and typing a new colour into it.

## Scope checklist (from roadmap)

- [x] `luaug edit [path]` in the CLI, with i18n keys and a spawned-process test
- [x] An editor mode in `engine/app`, gated like `--replay` / `--bench` / `--two-worlds`
- [x] A dockspace with Explorer, Properties, Viewport, Console and Stats as real windows
- [x] Layout persistence (`io.IniFilename` back on, with a decided location)
- [x] The world rendered into a texture and shown in the Viewport panel
- [x] Picking: a testable screen-point-to-ray function, and a ray that chooses an instance
- [x] A visible selection in the viewport — confirmed by the human at review, 2026-08-22
- [x] `PropertyDesc` carries the identity of the enum a property accepts
- [x] `docKey` stops being emitted empty, so properties can carry tooltips
- [x] D056: the `shipping` profile compiles, and a gate stage builds it
- [~] D057: the release notes now say what the binary is; choosing the profile is a human decision, see the Gate Record

## Scope added at review (2026-08-22), on the human's word

The review turned E1 from "the editor opens" into the whole loop, and then added
the content browser to it. Both were asked for as E1's own scope and as its
priority, and both are recorded here because a session that compacts its memory
keeps the files and not the conversation.

- [x] **The loop**: play remembers the world, stop puts it back, save writes it
- [x] Three run states — `Editing`, `Playing`, `Paused` — because "editing" and
      "paused in play mode" are not the same state and a two-state model makes
      the play button a toggle between things that are not opposites
- [x] The five wrong-owner defects: the tick (D058), the cursor (D059), the
      audio (D060), the camera (D061) and the input (D062)
- [ ] **A scene is an asset, and `content/` holds all of them.** Scenes move to
      `content/scenes/<name>.scene.json`, addressed by URN, resolved through
      `ContentMounts` like any other asset. This REVERSES the first
      implementation, which put one scene per project at the project root
- [ ] **A content browser panel** over the project's asset tree, with folders,
      docked beside the others
- [ ] **Opening a scene loads it**; the editor knows which one is open and saves
      back to that one
- [ ] **Creating a folder** from the panel
- [ ] The term is **scene**, never "place" (human decision, 2026-08-22): the
      Roblox comparison produced the design and is not a name this engine takes
- [ ] Virtualised, because the quality bar was stated as Unity and Unreal and
      for a browser that means it stays responsive over thousands of entries —
      `ImGuiListClipper` is vendored and nothing in this repository uses it yet

## NOT in scope

Manipulators of any kind. Undo or redo. Creating, deleting, renaming or
reparenting instances. Multi-select. Saving anything at all. A scene file
format. An asset browser. Prefabs. Play and stop. A second OS window. ImGui
multi-viewports. Distributing the editor as a downloadable product. Any change
to the game UI layer (ADR 0046 settled that it is not the editor's substrate).

**And one temptation with a name**: `luaug-chunk-source` is the only
instance-tree format on disk and it would be easy to teach it to hold a scene.
Its own header calls it "deliberately NARROW — this is not a general scene
serialization" on purpose. E3 decides that with an ADR; E1 does not decide it by
writing to it.

## Subagent plan

Interfaces frozen first, per MASTER_PROMPT §7. Three parts fan out because they
touch disjoint files and none of them is a seam between two modules; the editor
mode itself stays orchestrator-only, because it is exactly the cross-cutting
work §7 says not to hand out.

| Part | Files | Why it can fan out |
|---|---|---|
| Enum identity + `docKey` on `PropertyDesc` | `api/schema.luau`, `api/generator/gen_cpp.luau`, `engine/scene/include/luaug/scene/class_registry.h`, `engine/app/src/inspector.cpp` | Additive to a generator that already exists; its contract is one struct field and one emit |
| `luaug edit` in the CLI | `tools/cli/main.luau`, `tools/cli/commands/edit.luau`, `tools/cli/i18n/en.json`, `tools/cli/tests/edit.test.luau` | Entirely inside `tools/`; the engine flag it passes is frozen before it starts |
| D056 — the `shipping` profile | `engine/script/src/{modules,runtime}.cpp`, `engine/app/src/debug_overlay.cpp`, the gate scripts | A build-configuration defect with no overlap with editor code |

Orchestrator-only: the editor mode, the dockspace, the viewport render target,
picking, and the selection highlight.

## Gate checklist (verbatim from roadmap)

- [x] `luaug edit examples/10-open-world` opens, docks, and renders the world in its viewport; a screenshot is attached to the gate record.
- [x] Clicking a part in the viewport selects it: the Explorer highlights the same instance, the Properties panel shows its class, and the viewport draws the selection. Proven by a headless test that drives a synthetic click through the picking function, not by eye alone.
- [x] Picking has unit tests over a camera and a viewport rectangle covering: the centre of the screen, each corner, a click on empty space returning nothing, and a non-square viewport — the last because an aspect-ratio bug is invisible at the centre and wrong everywhere else.
- [x] Editing a property in the editor changes the world: the existing safe-point drain is used unchanged and a test asserts the write lands.
- [x] An enum-valued property offers its full set of items with no live instance needed to discover them, and a property with a doc string shows it.
- [x] The `shipping` profile compiles, and a gate stage builds it.
- [x] `scripts/localgate.ps1` green on every stage; `luaug check` clean; docs-lint clean.
- [ ] **A human opens the editor on the flagship and says whether it is an editor** — the gate item that is deliberately not automatable, and the one every milestone since M4 has proven is where the real defects come from.

## Findings

Filled during the milestone: the things the docs assumed that reality corrected.

**Finding 1 — the reconnaissance was worth more than it cost, and it changed the
milestone.** Five read-only passes over the repository, run in parallel before a
line was written, produced three things no amount of planning would have: that
ADR 0011 had already named the editor on the ImGui side four milestones earlier,
so the substrate was not an open question; that a Luau editor is *blocked* rather
than expensive, because the sandbox has no filesystem and R4 does not bend for
tooling; and that the deterministic world-hash walk in
`engine/scene/src/world_hash.cpp:182-278` is a whole-world serializer with a
`Hasher` where a writer should be, which is E3's answer found in E1's week.

**Finding 2 — a research claim is a lead, not a fact, and testing one found two
defects in a shipped release.** A reconnaissance pass reported that
`debug_overlay.cpp` defines `captureLog()` outside its own `#if LUAUG_DEBUG_UI`
and that the `shipping` profile should therefore fail to compile. Building it
found a *different* first failure — `luacode.h` included unguarded where the
profile turns the Luau compiler off — and the build died before it ever reached
the claimed one, which is still untested behind it. Following that thread found
D057: `luaug build` searches four presets for a host and `shipping` is not among
them, so the v1.0.0 binary published an hour earlier is a development build,
carrying the debug overlay and a Luau REPL into a release whose notes described
a player. The notes now say so.

**Finding 3 — a dockspace arranges nothing, and one screenshot said so.** The
first launch of the editor put every panel at ImGui's default position, which is
the same position: five windows in a pile with the viewport at the bottom of it.
Every test passed. `DockSpaceOverViewport` makes docking *possible* and does not
dock anything, so a default layout has to be built with `DockBuilder` on the
first run and only when no saved layout exists. This is the milestone's own
instance of the pattern this project keeps paying for -- and the cheapest one
yet, because looking cost one screenshot.

**Finding 4 — the shipping gate earned itself back on its first real use.** The
stage added for D056 caught three private fields on `DebugOverlay` that nothing
reads when ImGui is compiled out -- one of them a member I had added and never
used. MSVC says nothing about any of them; Clang's `-Wunused-private-field` under
`-Werror` says all three. The header's own design forbids `#ifdef`, so the honest
answer was `[[maybe_unused]]`, which states the true thing: a shipping build is
*meant* to be in that state.

**Finding 5 — `doctest::Approx` holds a double, and the Linux tier is why anybody
finds out.** Every float comparison in the new tests promoted silently under
MSVC and failed under Clang's `-Wdouble-promotion`. The repository already had
the idiom (`static_cast<f64>` at the comparison, `engine/core/tests/math_tests.cpp`);
what it did not have was anything to make a newcomer use it, which is what
`-Werror` on the second compiler is for.

## Attempted / abandoned

(append during the milestone)

## Gate Record

**SIGNED OFF 2026-08-22.** The human opened the editor, used it across eight
rounds of review, reported six of this milestone's seven defects by doing so, and
said close it.

Closing run, 2026-08-22, on the reference machine.

**`scripts/localgate.ps1` — green on all six stages:**

```
  ok    docs (14.2 s)
  ok    luau (10 s)
  ok    format (13.2 s)
  ok    windows (61.6 s)
  ok    linux (76.3 s)
  ok    shipping (21.5 s)
green (macOS is Tier-3 and only CI can build it)
```

44 ctest targets on Windows and 41 in the Tier-2 container, 1,109 conformance
cases on each.

**And the run before it failed, which is recorded rather than replaced.**
`openworld_soak` reported the world growing from 4,269 to 5,385 instances
between the second and fourth quarters, then passed twice in a row when re-run
alone minutes later on the same binary. It is D066, open and not quarantined --
§12 sets that bar at flaking twice and this is once, so it is written down for
the second time to be recognised as a second. The hypothesis the evidence
supports is that streaming's budget is denominated in milliseconds, which makes
the resident set sensitive to what else the machine is doing; the failing run
shared it with a container build and an interactive editor.

### The earlier run, for the record

**`scripts/localgate.ps1` — green on all six stages** (the sixth is new this
milestone):

```
  ok    docs (15.3 s)
  ok    luau (10.7 s)
  ok    format (16.4 s)
  ok    windows (73.7 s)
  ok    linux (93.6 s)
  ok    shipping (29.7 s)
green (macOS is Tier-3 and only CI can build it)
```

44 ctest targets on Windows and 41 in the Tier-2 container, both with
1,109 conformance cases passing. `luaug check` clean, docs-lint clean.

**Item by item.**

| Gate item | Result |
|---|---|
| `luaug edit examples/10-open-world` opens, docks, renders the world in its viewport | **Green.** `docs/images/e1/editor-first-light.png` |
| Clicking a part selects it: explorer, properties and viewport agree | **Green, and only a person could have said so.** The pick path is proven headlessly end to end (`engine/app/tests/editor_tests.cpp`) — a synthetic click at a viewport pixel selects the part in front of the camera and the inspector holds it — and the outline was **confirmed working by the human at review, 2026-08-22**. It could not be confirmed any other way: three attempts to drive the window with synthetic clicks produced nothing, because SDL does not accept injected input and the ImGui shell cannot render headlessly. The editor logs what it selected, by name and class, which is the evidence that survives the window closing |
| Picking unit tests: centre, corners, empty space, non-square viewport | **Green.** `engine/app/tests/picking_tests.cpp`, eleven cases, plus a rotated box, a ray starting inside one, and a ray parallel to a slab |
| Editing a property in the editor changes the world | **Green by inheritance, not by new evidence.** The editor drives the existing `Inspector` unchanged, and its safe-point drain is covered by `inspector_tests.cpp`. No test drives a property edit *through the editor shell* |
| An enum property offers its item set with no live instance; a documented property shows its doc | **Green.** `class_registry_tests.cpp` against the real generated tables (`Part.Shape` resolves to five items, `Anchored` names no enum) and `inspector_tests.cpp` |
| The `shipping` profile compiles, and a gate stage builds it | **Green.** D056 fixed; `scripts/gates/shipping-build.sh` builds and links it every run |
| Full local gate, `luaug check`, docs-lint | **Green**, above |
| **A human opens the editor and says whether it is an editor** | **Not done.** This is the milestone's sign-off and it is deliberately not automatable |

**The picture.** `docs/images/e1/editor-first-light.png` is the editor on the
flagship: the explorer showing the real tree from `DataModel` down through
`Workspace`, the character, the welds and all 289 streamed chunks; the viewport
rendering the world at 10.07 ms; properties and stats tabbed; the console
carrying the run's own log. The world is dark in it because the working tree had
`StartHour = 22.5` at the time, which is somebody's edit and not a setting of the
editor's.

**Layout persistence is verified by its artifact rather than by eye.** After a
first launch `examples/10-open-world/.luaug/editor-layout.ini` contains the
built arrangement — explorer 351 px left, viewport centre as `CentralNode=1`,
console below it, properties and stats tabbed right — and a second launch reads
it back instead of rebuilding.

### What this milestone became

Written as a list because eight rounds of review is not a paragraph. Each line is
something that did not exist when the milestone opened.

**The application.** A menu bar — File, Edit, Window, Help — with the open scene
named on the right. Dockable panels, a layout built on first launch and
remembered per person, panels closable from the Window menu and recoverable with
Reset Layout. Preferences, small and real rather than empty.

**The viewport.** Picking by ray with tests aimed at the corners, a selection
outline drawn from the world rather than the render snapshot, and a fly camera on
the right mouse button using SDL relative mode, anchored so the cursor comes back
where it was and with the UI frozen while it turns.

**The loop.** Three run states — `Editing`, `Playing`, `Paused` — with play and
stop sharing a button because they are opposites, and pause on its own because it
is a different question. Play snapshots the world; stop puts it back.

**The scene.** A format written by the same deterministic walk the world hash
makes, whose oracle is itself: write, read into a fresh world, write again,
require identical bytes. Scenes are assets under `content/`; a project declares
which one a RUN starts with and the editor remembers which one a PERSON had open.
What a system made — a streamed chunk — is not part of a scene.

**The content browser.** The source tree rather than the packed archive,
virtualised with `ImGuiListClipper`, with folders, creation, rename, delete, and
opening a scene by double-click.

**Undo and redo.** Snapshots rather than reversible commands, because undoing a
delete means recreating an instance, its subtree and its ids — which
`World::snapshot` already does correctly and a command stack does not. Bounded
depth, drag coalescing, and a redo that a new edit throws away.

**Seven defects, six found by a person opening the thing.** D058 the world
already running, D059 the cursor vanishing, D060 the audio playing, D061 the
camera flickering, D063 the pointer walking the UI, D064 the dead right-click,
D065 the deletable services. The seventh, D062, was found by looking for the
shape of the others. **Five of them are one architectural mistake appearing five
times** — the editor inheriting the game's decisions instead of taking them — and
the rule that resolves them is one sentence: *while the editor is editing, the
tool owns the machine, and pressing play hands it back.* It governs the tick, the
cursor, the audio, the camera and the keyboard.

**Two ADRs.** 0046, the editor as a mode of the host binary drawn in ImGui.
0047, the authored world becomes data and scripts become behaviour.

### What E1 deliberately does not have

**Manipulators.** Nothing can be moved by dragging it in the viewport; a
transform is changed by typing into the properties grid. That is E2's, and it is
the only large thing the first cut put in E2 that is still there.

**Creating an instance**, and reparenting by drag. Duplicate exists; making a
`Part` from nothing does not.

**Multi-select.** One instance at a time, everywhere.

**A VM that a stop puts back.** `World::snapshot` restores the world and not the
Luau state, so a connection a script made during play is still connected after
stop. The honest fix is a VM rebuild, and it is not free while projects still
build their worlds in script — which is what ADR 0047 changes over time and what
`examples/06-scene` exists to demonstrate.

**ADR 0047's boot order.** The lifecycle it describes is load-then-start; this
engine's `WorldHost::boot` starts the scripts as part of booting, and the scene
is applied after. For a project whose scripts do not build a world the two orders
agree, which is why `06-scene` works — and its own README says where they differ.

**`Destroying` for an editor's delete.** A paused world runs no signal drain, so
the editor retires what it deletes directly. No script is running to hear the
signal while editing, and when they run again the instance was never there.

**And one thing that cannot be evidenced at all**, measured rather than assumed:
the ImGui shell refuses to start without a window and SDL does not accept
injected input, so **there is no automated path to a picture of this editor or to
a click inside it**. Every image in `docs/images/e1/` was captured from a real
window. A milestone that wants a golden of the editor has to make the shell
render headlessly first.
