#
# DXC is SDL_shadercross's only HLSL front-end (ADR 0006). It is the one
# dependency that is a binary release artifact rather than a vendored source
# tree, because its source is a fork of LLVM and its archives carry an
# unassigned Microsoft EULA -- ADR 0032 has the full reasoning.
#
# `third_party/manifest.json` stays the single pin authority (R5): this file
# reads the `dxc` row out of it and never restates a URL or a hash, because two
# copies of a hash are two things that can drift.
#
# The hash IS the pin. A mismatch is a supply-chain event, so it is a hard
# error with no "update the hash to whatever we got" path -- changing a hash is
# a human edit to the manifest, exactly as changing a commit SHA is.

# Set unconditionally so `engine_add_shaders()` and third_party/CMakeLists.txt
# have one variable to branch on rather than re-deriving the platform rule.
