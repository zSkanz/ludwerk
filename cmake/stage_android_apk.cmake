# Why a staging step exists at all: ENG_SHADER_TOOLCHAIN defaults OFF when
# cross-compiling (cmake/engine_options.cmake -- shadercross is a HOST tool and
# DirectXShaderCompiler publishes no Android artifact), so the Android build
# produces a library and no shaders. The SPIR-V therefore comes from a Tier-1 or
# Tier-2 *host* build of the same commit, and something has to bring the two
# halves together. This is that something.
#
# Why a CMake script rather than a shell script: the same three commands have to
# work from PowerShell on the dev machine and from bash on the runner, and CMake
# is the one interpreter both already have.
#
# Why STAGE is outside the repository: this is build output, and R14 keeps build
# output out of the source tree. `samples/triangle/android/app/build.gradle`
# reads the location from `-Pengine.stageDir` for the same reason -- nothing is
# ever written into `app/src/main/`.
