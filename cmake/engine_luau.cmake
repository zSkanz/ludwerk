# Vendored Luau (ADR 0002, ADR 0013).
#
# Luau is added as a SYSTEM subdirectory so its headers never trip our
# warnings-as-errors profile, and with its CLI/tests/web targets off: we embed
# the libraries, we do not ship its tools.
#
# ABI note: LUA_VECTOR_SIZE / LUA_VECTOR_DOUBLE are set repo-wide in the root
# CMakeLists BEFORE this file is included, not per-target. They change the
# layout of every Luau value and the ordinal of LUA_TVECTOR in `lua_Type`
# (docs/research/luau-2026.md §1), so a translation unit compiled with a
# different value than the VM is silently, catastrophically wrong. Repo-wide
# is the only safe scope. C++ code additionally static_asserts them.

# EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL, and it is load-bearing rather than tidiness. Upstream creates
# twelve libraries unconditionally -- third_party/luau/CMakeLists.txt:31-57, with
# options guarding only the CLI, test and web targets (lines 9-15) -- and this
# engine links six: Common, Ast, Bytecode, Compiler, CodeGen, VM. The other six
# were compiled on every build and thrown away, Luau.Analysis worst of all: 407 s
# of the 1178 s of compile time a cold RelWithDebInfo build spent, 35% of it.
# Excluding them took a cold build on twenty cores from 53.9 s to 34.8 s.
#
# Upstream exposes no option to switch Analysis off, so the alternative was
# patching the vendored tree (R13). This does not need one: the `all` target
# stops reaching into Luau, and CMake still builds whatever the six linked
# libraries pull in transitively. The effect is exactly "build what we link and
# nothing else", and it keeps holding when the pin moves and upstream adds,
# renames or splits a library.

# is `luau-analyze` at the pinned version (ADR 0018), a tool, never a runtime
# dependency. Compiler is gated so shipping builds can drop it and load only
# precompiled bytecode (ADR 0002).
