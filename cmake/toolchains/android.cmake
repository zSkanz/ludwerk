# Android cross-compile toolchain -- nightly, compile-only
# (architecture.md §8; roadmap "Early Android portability check").
#
# Mobile is post-v1 (R15). This file exists for one reason: so that a toolchain
# or API break in `platform` / `rhi_api` / `rhi_sdlgpu` is found the night it
# lands instead of at the M4 device checkpoint, when the RHI interface is about
# to freeze. Nothing here is a step toward shipping on Android.
#
# It is a thin wrapper over the NDK's own android.toolchain.cmake rather than a
# hand-written toolchain, because the NDK owns the mapping from ABI and API
# level to triple, sysroot and link flags -- a local copy of that mapping rots
# silently with the next NDK release and the symptom is a miscompile, not an
# error. What lives here is the part the NDK does not own: the pins (R5), and
# the check that the NDK actually used is the pinned one.

# The single pin. .github/workflows/nightly.yml reads this literal back out of
# this file to decide which NDK to install, so the repository contains one
# version string rather than two that can drift apart -- and the revision
# assertion below turns any drift into a configure error instead of a build
# against a different compiler than the one named here.
