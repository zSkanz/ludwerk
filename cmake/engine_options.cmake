# The C++ suite drives the engine through Luau SOURCE -- every conformance and
# integration case is a script, and `sandbox_tests.cpp` compiles chunks with
# `luau_compile` directly to ask what a chunk can reach. None of that exists in
# the shipping profile, which links no compiler (ADR 0002), so a test suite built
# there would be one that cannot run. Dependent rather than plain for the same
# reason ENG_DEBUG_UI is: the profile is not something a `-D` should be able to
# contradict by accident. It is also what keeps the shipping gate cheap -- that
# profile builds the shipping binary and nothing else.
#
# Off for `player` as well, and for a different reason: that profile IS a
# shipped artifact -- `ludwerk build` packages it -- so compiling doctest and a
# hundred test translation units into the same tree is work nobody asked for.
# It is not a claim that the profile is untested; the gate builds and links it
# on every run, which is exactly what `shipping` gets and for the same argument.
#
# **Off for `editor` for that second reason exactly** (ADR 0054). That profile is
# what `tools/repo/package.luau` copies into the archive somebody downloads, and
# a packaging run that first compiles the C++ suite pays for a thing it then
# does not ship.

# `ludwerk build` ships a game's Luau as SOURCE (ADR 0045), so the binary it
# packages has to be able to compile source -- which ruled `shipping` out and
# left it packaging `dev`, overlay and REPL and all. The two options were only
# ever tied together by sharing a profile string, so the fix is a profile that
# takes one and not the other.

# --- Backend selection (ADR 0023) -------------------------------------------
# Chosen at build time; `app` holds the one hand-written switch over what was
# compiled in. A shipping build carries exactly one real backend per seam.
#
# `rhi_null` is not a debugging convenience: headless logic tests and the future
# dedicated server need an IDevice that renders nothing, so it is part of the
# normal build rather than something a preset turns on.
# The exotic-format importer in `assetc` (ADR 0010: offline tool only, never the
# runtime). ON by default because a pipeline that cannot read an FBX is a
# pipeline most people cannot use -- and an option at all because assimp is the
# largest single compile in this tree and somebody iterating on the engine has
# no reason to pay for it.
option(ENG_ASSETC_ASSIMP "Build assimp into assetc for exotic mesh formats" ON)

# **The real-image golden suite both architecture.md §9 and roadmap promise**,
# and it is OFF because they both say "non-blocking" (S7.6).
#
# These compare pixels against images recorded on Mesa's software rasterizer.
# That is a legitimate exact comparison -- lavapipe is bit-identical to itself,
# measured at zero differing pixels across two runs -- and it is legitimate on
# NOTHING else: a discrete GPU rasterizes edges by different rules, which is the
# whole reason `screenshot_gate` carries the `gpu-golden` label.
#
# So the tests do not exist unless something asks for them. A Mesa upgrade in
# the Tier-2 image will move every pixel of every one of these, and that must
# not be able to redden the gate somebody runs before a push. Asked for by the
# nightly job and by `scripts/localgate.ps1 -Only lavapipe`.

# --- Shader toolchain (ADR 0006, ADR 0032) ----------------------------------
# The defaults encode decisions rather than discovering them at build time.
#
# Off when cross-compiling, because shadercross is a HOST tool -- it runs during
# the build to produce blobs, and architecture.md §8 says so explicitly ("builds
# once as a host tool, also used when cross-compiling"). A cross build has no
# business compiling a compiler for its target, and DirectXShaderCompiler
# publishes no artifact for one either, so the nightly Android job would fail at
# configure trying to fetch something that does not exist. Shaders for a
# cross-compiled target come from a host build.
#
# Off on macOS, because Microsoft publishes no macOS DirectXShaderCompiler
# binary at all (ADR 0032 states this consequence). Forcing it ON there is
# allowed and fails with that explanation rather than a confusing not-found.
#
# It stays an option rather than becoming a hard platform rule because turning
# it off is also how a build that only consumes precompiled shader blobs skips
# the whole toolchain.

# --- Debug UI (ADR 0011) -----------------------------------------------------
# Dear ImGui, dev-facing only and compiled out of shipping builds. Gating the
# TARGET rather than the call sites is what makes "a shipping binary contains no
# ImGui" a checkable claim: there is no object file to find, because none was
# compiled. `app`'s overlay degrades to a class whose methods do nothing, not to
# an #ifdef at every call site.
#
# The second condition is not defensive. The only ImGui renderer backend this
# repository compiles is the SDL_GPU one, so a build without that RHI backend
# has nothing for the overlay to draw with -- and an overlay target that cannot
# render is a link error waiting for whoever switches the option on.
#
# **Off for `player` too** (D057), which is the option this profile exists to
# turn off: a released game carried the overlay, the inspector and a Luau REPL
# against its own VM, because the only profile without them could not compile
# the Luau the game ships as source.
#
# **On for `editor`, which is what that profile is** (ADR 0054). The editor is
# drawn in ImGui (ADR 0046) and is a dev build by nature; what separates it from
# `dev` is not a feature but the difference between a build tree and an artifact
# somebody downloads.
