// The resolve: the `Rgba16Float` HDR target to the swapchain, with exposure.
// The first fullscreen pass in the engine and the first time the swapchain is
// not the only colour target (M4 brief, Decision 11).
//
// **The operator is Khronos PBR Neutral** (KhronosGroup/ToneMapping, the glTF
// viewer's default since 2024), and the reason is what M4 is for. This is the
// milestone where an imported glTF file first appears on screen, and every
// question asked of the result -- does this material look like the file says it
// looks, did the importer read baseColorFactor correctly, is the golden image
// showing a bug or a look -- is a question about hue. ACES's filmic fit answers
// it badly: it is cheap and it is the industry default, but it rotates
// saturated hues towards orange as they brighten, so a red that is wrong and a
// red that is merely bright arrive at the same pixel. PBR Neutral is the same
// order of cost, is monotone in luminance, and desaturates only in the
// highlight roll-off, which leaves a material's colour recognisable right up to
// the point it clips. Reinhard was rejected for the opposite reason: it never
// really reaches white, so every bright surface reads as washed out.
//
// **sRGB encoding happens here and nowhere else.** The swapchain is claimed with
// SDL_GPU's default SDR composition, which is a plain `B8G8R8A8_UNORM`
// (third_party/sdl3/src/gpu/vulkan/SDL_gpu_vulkan.c:245-246): the display wants
// sRGB-encoded bytes and that format applies no transfer function, so this
// shader applies it. Its counterpart, the decode, is the texture format's job --
// base colour and emissive are `Rgba8UnormSrgb` and the sampler linearises them;
// normal and metallic-roughness maps stay `Rgba8Unorm` because their contents
// were never colours. If the swapchain ever becomes `SDR_LINEAR`, the hardware
// starts encoding and `encodeSrgb` below must go, or it happens twice and the
// image turns pale.

// **Photography's answer is 0.18, and 0.18 is wrong here**, for a reason worth
// stating rather than fudging: 0.18 is middle grey in PHOTOMETRIC units, and
// this engine's radiance unit is arbitrary. `Lighting.Brightness` defaults to
// 2.6 because 2.6 looked right, not because it is 2.6 of anything. The constant
// that maps an arbitrary unit onto display grey is therefore a CALIBRATION, and
// calibrating it against 0.18 would be borrowing a number from a scale nothing
// here is on.
//
// 0.45 is that calibration, and the method was: every scene in the repository
// was authored against the fixed exposure of 1.0 this pass replaced, so the key
// is chosen to leave those scenes at the level they were authored at. That makes
// automatic exposure a STABILISER -- it holds a scene's level as its light
// changes -- rather than a change of level applied to all existing content.
