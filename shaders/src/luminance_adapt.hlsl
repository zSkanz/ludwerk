// Automatic exposure, pass three of three: the last reduction to one texel, and
// the adaptation that keeps it from snapping.
//
// **This pass carries state**, which is what makes it the odd one in the chain:
// it samples LAST frame's exposure from one 1x1 texture and writes this frame's
// into another, and the renderer swaps the two. That ping-pong is how a value
// survives a frame in a renderer with no compute and no readback a frame can
// afford.
//
// **The rate is per FRAME rather than per second.** A rate driven by elapsed
// wall-clock time would make a screenshot at frame thirty a different picture on
// a fast machine and a slow one, and the goldens are the reason that matters
// (R10 in spirit, and the observation rule in practice). The cost is honest and
// small: adaptation feels slightly quicker at a high frame rate.
