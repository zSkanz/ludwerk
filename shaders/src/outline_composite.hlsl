// The editor's selection outline, drawn from the mask.
//
// A dilate minus the mask itself: a pixel the mask does not cover but one of
// whose neighbours within the outline's width does is an edge pixel, and the
// set of those is the silhouette of everything selected. That is the whole
// mechanism, and it is why this produces an outline around a tree rather than
// around a tree's bounding box.
//
// **Outside rather than on the shape.** Growing outwards leaves the object
// itself untouched, so a selected part still shows its own colour and its own
// shading -- an outline drawn ON the silhouette eats a pixel of whatever it is
// meant to be helping you look at.
//
// Two selected objects that touch on screen produce ONE outline around the
// union, not a seam between them, because the mask does not distinguish them.
// That is the right answer: they are one selection.
//
// The fill is a flat tint over the mask, kept low. It is what tells a selected
// object apart from an unselected one BEHIND a selected one, which an outline
// alone cannot -- and it is the half that has to stay subtle, because a strong
// one hides the colour somebody selected the part to change.
