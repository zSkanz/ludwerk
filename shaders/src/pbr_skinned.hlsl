// The forward pass for a SKINNED mesh: `pbr.hlsl`'s shading, reached through a
// linear blend of up to four joints per vertex (roadmap M6, "minimal skeletal
// animation").
//
// **A separate entry file rather than a `#define` inside `pbr.hlsl`.** The two
// differ in their vertex INPUT layout, which is part of the pipeline description
// and not of the code -- one shader with a branch would still have to declare
// the joint and weight attributes, and every static mesh in every world would
// then carry two more vertex attributes it never reads (M6 brief, Decision 11).
//
// **The fragment stage is genuinely shared now** rather than pasted: both files
// include `engine_forward.hlsli`, which owns the texture slots, the interpolants
// and `shadeForward`. Until M7.5 it was a copy, which was fine while it was one
// screen and stopped being fine when it grew image-based lighting.
//
// The extra vertex buffer is `asset::SkinVertex` (engine/asset/include/engine/
// asset/model.h) at slot 1: four `uint16` joint indices then four `float`
// weights, 24 bytes, parallel to the position stream by construction.
//
// Register spaces are fixed per stage by SDL_GPU and a shader that ignores them
// binds nothing (SDL_gpu.h:2699-2730).
