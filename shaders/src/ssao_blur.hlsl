// The depth-aware blur that makes the occlusion term usable.
//
// Separable, so one pipeline is drawn twice with a different direction -- which
// is why `GpuBlurUniforms` carries the direction rather than the shader assuming
// one. Nine taps.
//
// **Depth-aware rather than plain**: a Gaussian across a silhouette drags the
// occlusion of a near object onto a far one, and that reads as a dark halo,
// which is the most recognisable way a first ambient-occlusion pass looks wrong.
// Taps whose depth is far from the centre's are dropped rather than weighted
// down, because a partial contribution from the wrong surface is still the wrong
// surface.
