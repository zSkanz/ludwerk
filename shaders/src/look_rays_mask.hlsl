// **Only the open sky can.** A texel where the depth buffer holds the far plane
// is sky, and anything nearer is something standing in front of it -- so a
// tree, a wall or a pillar is a hole in this mask, and the gather that follows
// streams light past the hole rather than through it. The sky's own light is
// kept, weighted towards the sun, so the shafts are the sun's colour at noon and
// at dusk alike and the rest of the sky adds only a little.
