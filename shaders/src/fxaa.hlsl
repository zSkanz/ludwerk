// The anti-aliasing resolve: FXAA, on the tonemapped sRGB image.
//
// **Spatial rather than temporal, and that is a decision rather than a
// shortcut** (M7.5 brief, Decision 10). The post chain owes anti-aliasing; it
// does not owe a velocity buffer with no consumer. Temporal anti-aliasing needs
// exactly two things a temporal upscaler needs -- a per-pixel motion vector and
// a jitterable projection -- and the roadmap asks for those to be DECLARED as
// renderer outputs rather than built as private state of a pass. The jitter
// ships (`RenderCamera::jitter`, zero everywhere); the velocity target does not,
// because a second render target on every forward draw is renderer-wide
// bandwidth for a consumer that does not exist.
//
// Nothing here forecloses it: FXAA reads the final image and writes the
// swapchain, so a temporal pass would replace this one rather than fight it.
//
// The algorithm is the published FXAA 3.11 console variant, at the quality end:
// find the local contrast, bail where there is none, then step along the edge
// looking for where it ends and blend across it. It works on PERCEPTUAL
// luminance -- this pass runs after `tonemap.hlsl` has encoded sRGB, which is
// exactly where FXAA expects to be, because an edge in linear light is not the
// edge a person sees.
