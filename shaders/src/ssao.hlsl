// Screen-space ambient occlusion, from the depth the PREPASS wrote.
//
// **Depth is readable here because a prepass wrote it and nothing has it
// attached** -- that is the roadmap's design constraint for M7.5, answered while
// the pass list was open rather than afterwards (brief, Decision 8). What it
// does NOT answer is a blended pass sampling the depth it is attached to, which
// is what water foam needs; that is one RHI field or one copy call and it is
// named rather than implied.
//
// **The normal is reconstructed from depth derivatives**, not read from a
// G-buffer. A forward renderer that grows a normal target has grown half a
// deferred one, and the cost of the reconstruction is a wrong normal along a
// silhouette -- which the depth-aware blur after this pass mostly eats.
//
// The occlusion term produced here multiplies the IMAGE-BASED and ambient terms
// and nothing else. A surface's occlusion of the environment says nothing about
// whether the sun reaches it, and the sun has a shadow map that answers exactly
// that (brief, Decision 13).
