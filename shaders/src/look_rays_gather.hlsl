// Sun rays, second of two (ADR 0096): every texel gathers the mask along the
// line from itself towards the sun.
//
// Light that reaches the camera past an edge travels along that line, so
// walking it and summing what shines is a shaft: bright where the line crosses
// open sky near the sun, dark where it crosses something that blocks it. Each
// step counts a little less than the one before, which is what makes a shaft
// fade with its length instead of ending in a cut. The sun itself may be off
// the screen; the line still points at it, and the renderer has already faded
// the whole effect by how far off it is.
