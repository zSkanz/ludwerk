// A picture into a target of another size, filtered: the last step of a blur
// that ran at a fraction of the frame, bringing it back to the frame's own size
// so every pass after it reads a full-resolution image as it always has
// (ADR 0096).
//
// Bilinear is enough here and that is not a shortcut: what it reads is already
// a Gaussian at least two texels wide, so the step between two of its texels is
// smaller than the blur itself.
