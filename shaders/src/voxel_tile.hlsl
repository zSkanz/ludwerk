// One block image into its tile of the block atlas (V1).
//
// **The atlas is filled by drawing, not by copying**, and that is what lets it
// hold COMPILED images: a texture the asset compiler turned into BC7 has no
// pixels the CPU could pack, but it can be sampled -- so each one is drawn,
// once, into its square of an ordinary colour target, and the block shader
// reads the atlas. The viewport is the tile; the triangle covers it.
//
// Sampled without smoothing, because a block image is usually a handful of
// pixels meant to stay crisp: a sixteen-pixel grass top drawn into a sixty-four
// pixel tile is four copies of each pixel, not a blur.
