// Depth of field, second of three (ADR 0096): each half-resolution texel
// gathers the texels whose circles reach it.
//
// A blur by distance is a SCATTER -- every point spreads into its own circle --
// and a fragment shader can only gather, so each texel asks its neighbours
// whether their circles cover it. Thirty-two of them, on a sunflower spiral out
// to the widest circle there is, so the disc is filled evenly at every radius.
//
// **What is behind may not blur over what is in front.** A neighbour further
// away than this texel contributes only as far as THIS texel's own circle
// reaches: a blurred distance does not bleed across a sharp post standing in
// front of it. A NEARER neighbour contributes as far as its own circle reaches,
// which is what lets a blurred foreground spread over what is behind it -- and
// how much of that happened is written out beside the colour, so the composite
// knows to take the blur there even where this texel itself is sharp.
