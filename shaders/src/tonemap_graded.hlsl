// `ColorCorrectionEffect` of the frame composed into one affine map (ADR 0096,
// `render::resolveLook`).
//
// **A second pipeline rather than a branch in the first**, and the reason is
// every golden in the repository. A world with no colour correction must draw
// through exactly the shader it always drew through -- the same bytes, the same
// uniform block -- so this file includes that one whole, renames its entry
// point out of the way, and adds its own. The renderer makes this pipeline the
// first frame a grade exists, as it does the decals', so a world without one
// never builds it.
//
// The grade sits where the class's documentation says: on the exposed light,
// before the curve, so a highlight it brightens still rolls off rather than
// clipping.
