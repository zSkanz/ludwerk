// Automatic exposure, pass one of three: the HDR frame reduced to a small grid
// of LOG luminance.
//
// **Log rather than linear**, and the difference is the whole reason exposure
// works: a linear average is dominated by the brightest pixels, so one specular
// highlight closes the aperture on the whole scene. The geometric mean -- which
// is what an average of logarithms is -- reads as the brightness a person would
// say the scene has.
//
// A sparse four-tap read rather than an exhaustive one. This is a perceptual
// control and not a measurement: the difference between averaging every pixel
// and averaging a bilinear sample of sixteen per output texel is far below the
// eye's ability to notice the exposure being slightly off.
