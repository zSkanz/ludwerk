// so `tonemap.hlsl` resolves sky and geometry together and the sun disc can be
// brighter than 1.0 without clipping on the way out.
//
// Drawn first, with depth write off, which is why the depth it emits does not
// matter much -- it emits 1.0, the far plane in the engine's [0, 1] convention,
// so that a pass which ever does enable the depth test still puts the sky behind
// everything rather than in front of it.
//
// The vertex stage reads no uniforms and no vertex buffer; `GpuSkyUniforms` is a
// fragment-stage block because turning a screen position back into a direction
// is a per-pixel job.
