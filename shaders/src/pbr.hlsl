// The forward pass for a STATIC mesh: metallic-roughness PBR, one shadowed
// directional sun, up to `kMaxForwardLights` punctual lights, image-based
// lighting, then distance fog. It is the default shader every material names
// unless it names another (`MaterialDef::shader`).
//
// **One shader, two pipelines.** The opaque and the blended passes compile the
// same code and differ only in their pipeline state -- depth-write and blending
// -- because a fragment's colour does not depend on which pass drew it. What
// differs is the order, and `extract` owns that (M4's third design constraint).
//
// **The fragment stage lives in `engine_forward.hlsli`** and is shared with
// `pbr_skinned.hlsl`. It was a copy in both files until M7.5 gave it enough to
// do that two copies became two shaders waiting to disagree; that header says
// so at length. What is left here is the one thing that genuinely differs
// between the two: the vertex input layout and the vertex stage.
//
// It writes **linear HDR** into an `Rgba16Float` target. Nothing here tonemaps
// and nothing here encodes sRGB -- `tonemap.hlsl` does both, once, on the way to
// the swapchain.
//
// Register spaces are fixed per stage by SDL_GPU and a shader that ignores them
// binds nothing (SDL_gpu.h:2699-2730). Vertex inputs use TEXCOORDn semantics
// because that is what SDL_shadercross maps to SPIR-V input locations, and the
// declaration order below is the location order.
//
// The vertex layout is `asset::Vertex` (engine/asset/include/engine/asset/
// model.h): 48 bytes interleaved, position float3 / normal float3 / tangent
// float4 / uv float2, with `tangent.w` the bitangent handedness sign that glTF
// defines.
