// Particles (F2): one camera-facing square per instance, shaped in the shader.
//
// **No vertex buffer at all.** Each particle is an instance -- position and
// size, colour, and how it blends -- and its six corners come from the vertex
// index, so ten thousand particles are one instanced draw of six vertices.
//
// **One pipeline for both kinds of particle**, blended premultiplied: the
// colour is multiplied by its opacity here, and the alpha written is the
// opacity times what is NOT emission. At emission 0 that is an ordinary blend;
// at 1 the alpha is zero and the colour simply adds -- fire and sparks -- and
// between is both, with no second pipeline and no sort between the two kinds.
//
// **Soft, and tested against the scene by hand.** The pass has no depth
// attachment: it reads the depth the opaque surfaces wrote as a texture, which
// a pass with it attached cannot (decals are drawn the same way). A fragment
// behind the scene is dropped, which is the depth test; one in front of it
// fades out over the last stretch before the surface it would cross, which is
// what stops a puff of smoke drawing a hard line where it meets the ground.
// The stretch is the particle's own half-size, up to a metre: a spark stays
// crisp and a cloud fades over the cloud's depth.
