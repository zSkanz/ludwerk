// Until the terrain has texture sets, the variation is procedural: three
// octaves of value noise, laid triplanar and pinned to the FIELD's own coordinates so nothing swims
// when the camera moves -- patches of about 37 m, clumps of about 4 m and grain
// of about half a metre -- and a slope rule that turns steep ground to rock the
// way the reference terrains' "autoshader" does.
