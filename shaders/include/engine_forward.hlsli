//
// **It was a copy until M7.5.** M6's note in `pbr_skinned.hlsl` said the right
// thing -- the fragment stage "is shared and is `pbr.hlsl`'s, compiled again"
// -- and then said it in a second file with the whole function pasted into it.
// That held while the function was one screen. This milestone gives it image-
// based lighting, cascades, a cluster lookup and an occlusion term, and two
// copies of that is two shaders that will disagree on the day one of them is
// edited alone.
//
// So the texture slots, the interpolants and the shading live here, and each
// entry file supplies only what actually differs: its vertex INPUT layout and
// its vertex stage. That difference is real and is why there are still two
// pipelines (M6 brief, Decision 11) -- one shader with a branch would make every
// static mesh in every world carry joint and weight attributes it never reads.
//
// **Every one of the eleven fragment texture slots must always have something
// bound.** The material's `TextureFlags` are multipliers rather than branches
// (`shader_types.h` says why), so the sample happens whether the material has
// that texture or not, and a slot the renderer leaves empty is an unbound
// descriptor read. A 1x1 default is the whole fix.
