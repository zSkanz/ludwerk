# CLAUDE.md — Standing Guidance for Agent Sessions

**If you are the autonomous builder: your mission is [`MASTER_PROMPT.md`](MASTER_PROMPT.md).
Read it first and follow its Boot Sequence (§2). This file is only the quick
digest for any agent touching this repo.**

## What this repo is

Ludwerk — an open-source (Apache-2.0) standalone game engine: C++ core embedding
Luau 0.734 directly, Roblox-familiar Instance/Service API over a data-oriented
ECS, deterministic fixed-tick simulation, SDL3 + custom RHI (SDL3 GPU default),
Jolt physics, code-first DX with hot reload. **v2.0.0 is released** (2026-09-26):
the engine (`v1.0.0`, M0 through M8), the visual editor (`v1.1.0`), and the
post-v1 phases after them — materials and surface shaders, terrain and block
worlds, particles and decals, UI in the world, the 2D layer, navigation, and
multiplayer with teams, ownership and rollback. Since then, on `main`: Android
(touch, screen orientation, a game packaged as an APK), and ADRs 0105 and 0106 —
code in three script services (`ServerScriptService` and `ClientScriptService`
per scene, `GlobalScriptService` for the whole game; `ScriptService` retired),
scenes changed at run time, a match joined and hosted from a script, and
attributes that replicate. **What is being built now** is three ledgers in
`docs/briefs/`, preceded since 2026-09-27 by the owner's queue
(`owner-queue-2026-09-27.md`: defects, then `UIGradient`/`UIStroke`, then the
editor remade after VS Code), in this order: `export-and-server-kickoff.md` (ADR 0104, the
export window and targets), `rename-kickoff.md` (ADR 0109: the brand becomes
**Ludwerk**, and the code takes the neutral internal name `engine` --
`engine::`, `ENG_*`, `project.toml`, `@engine/` -- with the brand read from
`branding/brand.toml` alone), `views-kickoff.md` (ADR 0107, cameras into
textures, `ViewportFrame`, sub-worlds), then `game-ready-plan.md` (ADRs 0111
to 0123: saves, HTTPS, terrain materials, foliage, wind, water, the network
service, encryption, editable primitives, video and parallel scripts, in five
ledgers it orders), and `ai-kickoff.md` (ADR 0108, the MCP server and the AI panel).
**Since 2026-10-10 the owner's order of work is `level-up-roadmap.md`**: nine
categories built one whole category at a time, each with one full gate at its
end -- animation (state machine, IK, retargeting), indirect light, cinematics,
the editor's profiler and material nodes, physics (vehicles, mesh cloth,
destruction), audio (occlusion, voice), the world (automatic LOD, occlusion
culling), the web, and a package manager. `PROGRESS.md` says where things stand, and it is the
file to trust when this paragraph and it disagree.

## Commands

**Run the gates locally. Do not use CI as your test runner.**

```
scripts/localgate.ps1                # EVERYTHING that can run here: docs + Luau gates
                                     #   + Windows build/tests + the Linux tier in Docker
                                     #   + the shipping and player profiles nothing else builds
scripts/localgate.ps1 -Only windows  # one stage: docs | luau | format | windows | linux | shipping | android
scripts/install-android.ps1          # the pinned NDK, SDK 35, adb, JDK 17 and Gradle; the
                                     #   `android` stage then cross-builds arm64 on every run
```

**Run the Linux stage.** It is ~12 s warm, and it is not redundant with the
Windows one: Clang diagnoses things MSVC does not, warnings are errors, and this
has already caught a real defect that would otherwise have gone to CI. Use
`-Only` when iterating on one thing; the full gate before you push.

`-SkipLinux` exists for one situation — Docker is genuinely unavailable — and
using it means accepting that a Clang-only diagnostic reaches `main` instead of
you.

Roughly 90 seconds warm for the full six stages, 27 tests on Windows and 26 on
Linux. The same run costs ~68 wall-clock minutes on GitHub. **The repository went
public on 2026-08-27**, so standard GitHub-hosted runners are now free and the
platform multipliers (Linux 1×, Windows 2×, macOS 10×) that this paragraph used
to plan around no longer bill anything — CI had been dark for a billing block
until then, every job dying in 8 to 12 seconds with zero steps recorded.

**None of that changes what CI is for.** It is there to prove `main` is green
after a push and to build macOS — it is not where you find out whether your
change compiles. Free minutes are not a reason to push a build you have not run:
a red `main` is a red `main` whoever paid for it, and the round trip is twenty
minutes against ninety seconds.

The gate logic lives in `scripts/gates/*.sh`, and `ci.yml` runs the same files.
If you add a check, add it there, not in the workflow.

**Only macOS cannot run locally.** It is **blocking on every push that touches
code** (M4's gate item), and skipped on a documentation-only push and on a
`milestone/*` tag — the tag points at a commit the job already built when it
landed.

Underneath, when you need a single step:

```
scripts/bootstrap.ps1                # Windows: toolchain check, ENG_BUILD_ROOT, rokit install, lute setup
./scripts/bootstrap.sh               # Linux/macOS: same
lute tools/repo/vendor.luau status   # what is vendored vs what the manifest pins
cmake --preset win-msvc-dev          # configure (build dir OUTSIDE the repo tree)
cmake --build --preset win-msvc-dev  # build
ctest --preset win-msvc-dev          # C++ unit + integration tests
scripts/gates/clang-format.sh        # C++ formatting, at the pinned clang-format 18
                                     #   (Windows: scripts/localgate.ps1 -Only format [-Fix],
                                     #    which runs it in the Tier-2 container -- VS ships 20,
                                     #    and a different major reformats the whole tree)
stylua --check .                     # formatting (third_party via .styluaignore)
luau-lsp analyze --platform=standard --ignore="**/.lute/**" <files>
lute tools/repo/i18nlint.luau        # every ENG_TR key exists in i18n/en.json
lute tools/repo/checklayers.luau     # module layering from real #include edges
```

Active from M3: `ludwerk dev` (hot-reload dev server) · `ludwerk test` (conformance
specs, headless engine) · `ludwerk check` (luau-analyze strict + StyLua + i18n
lint) · `ludwerk new <template>` · `ludwerk fmt`.

### Things that will waste an hour if you do not know them

- **Run the engine from a package folder, by its sha. Never from the build
  tree, and never from a path another step rewrites.** A tool that launches
  the engine -- a capture, a check, a game being tried -- reads
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\<brand>\build\packages\current.txt` for the newest sha and
  runs `packages\<sha>\<brand>-<version>-win64\engine-host.exe`.
  `scripts/package-step.ps1` writes each package to a folder of its own and
  never rewrites one, so a host running from an older package keeps running.
  A host run out of the build tree holds the file the linker is about to
  write: the gate fails with `LNK1168`, and an object file left half written
  fails the next build with `LNK1236`. That cost a day before its cause was
  found (another session's captures).
- **Windows: the presets need a Developer Shell.** They use the Ninja generator
  with `strategy: external`, so `cl`, `cmake` and `ninja` must already be on
  PATH. Visual Studio bundles CMake and Ninja — the fix is almost never "install
  CMake", it is to run `VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat` first. `bootstrap.ps1`
  detects this and prints the exact command.
- **Build with `chcp 65001` on Windows, always.** CMake writes ninja's
  `msvc_deps_prefix` as UTF-8; a LOCALISED MSVC emits that string in the console
  codepage, the two never match, and ninja then records **no header dependencies
  at all** — every incremental build silently reuses objects compiled against an
  older header, and the symptom is an access violation in code that has nothing
  wrong with it. `scripts/localgate.ps1` sets it; a hand-run `cmake --build`
  must too. Four debugging sessions were spent on the symptom before anybody
  looked at the cause (D040).
- **`pwsh` (PowerShell 7) may not be installed**; Windows PowerShell 5.1 runs
  the bootstrap fine. Invoke the script directly rather than assuming a shell.
- **rokit needs `--no-trust-check`** in any non-interactive session, or
  `rokit install` blocks on a trust prompt. `bootstrap` already passes it.
- **`lute setup` must have run** or luau-lsp cannot resolve a single `@std`
  require under `tools/` (see `tools/.luaurc`). `bootstrap` does it.
- **CI uses `cancel-in-progress: true`.** Pushing cancels any run still in
  flight — do not push while waiting on a result you care about.
- **Docker Desktop must be running** for `scripts/localgate.ps1`'s Linux stage.
  Without it, pass `-SkipLinux` — but then a Clang-only diagnostic reaches CI
  instead of you, and `-Werror` means that is a red `main`.
- **Windows PowerShell reports native commands' success backwards.** `$?` is set
  from whether the command wrote to stderr, not from its exit code, and
  `$ErrorActionPreference='Stop'` turns any stderr line into an exception —
  Docker's buildkit writes ordinary progress there. Check `$LASTEXITCODE`, and
  never pipe a build through `tail`/`head`: the pager's exit code replaces the
  build's, which has already once reported a broken build as green.
- **`--dirty` on a `git describe` in this repo is slow**, and catastrophically so
  through a Docker mount (0.7 s native, 37 s in the container) because it stats
  every vendored file. `third_party/CMakeLists.txt` sets a git ceiling so
  vendored projects cannot reach our repository at all.

## Invariants (digest — full text in MASTER_PROMPT.md §3)

R1 English everywhere · R2 all Luau `--!strict` new solver; no `class`/`integer`
syntax · R3 no hardcoded user-facing strings (i18n keys) · R4 sandbox always ·
R5 pinned versions only · R6 permissive licenses only · R7 clean-room re Roblox
· R8 deferred-only signals; no legacy globals · R9 vector = 3-wide f32; f64
world coords engine-side · R10 sim determinism (no wall-clock/unseeded
RNG/unordered iteration; stable parallel commit) · R11 main always green ·
R12 conventional commits · R13 never edit `third_party/` in place ·
R14 out-of-tree builds only · R15 v1 scope closed, and post-v1 phases open one
at a time by human decision (1 editor, 2 effects/world, 3 2D and navmesh, and 4
multiplayer are OPEN; mobile is OPEN for Android since 2026-09-26, iOS is not; Xbox/UWP and local co-op are OPEN since 2026-10-09; the web is OPEN since 2026-10-10) · R16 interpreter-first perf (iOS has no
JIT) · R17 no backend
types in the public API · R18 rendering is judged against a stated reference,
and visual fidelity is a v1 target (ADR 0038).

## Style

- C++20 per `.clang-format` (4-space, 120 cols); warnings-as-errors on
  `engine/`; namespaces `engine::<module>`; files `snake_case`.
- Luau per `stylua.toml` + `.luaurc` (strict). **Naming (ADR 0034): index it
  off an *object* and it is PascalCase** (`part.Name`, `part:Destroy()`,
  `v.Magnitude`); **index it off a *module or namespace* and it is camelCase**,
  constructors included (`Instance.new`, `CFrame.fromEuler`, `Color3.fromRGB`,
  `CFrame.identity`, `task.spawn`, and whatever `@std/*` and `@engine/*`
  export). Type and class names are PascalCase.
- Inside our own Luau files: **module-level variables and constants are
  PascalCase with no underscores** (no `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE` anywhere),
  locals and inner functions are camelCase, and module-level functions stay
  camelCase because a module is not an object.
- Comments explain *why* and contracts, never narrate code.

## Do-not list

- Do not edit anything under `third_party/` (use `third_party/patches/` + manifest).
- Do not commit build output, generated-file edits, or secrets.
- Do not disable sandbox, strict mode, or lints to make CI pass.
- Do not add/upgrade dependencies without a human-approved ADR.
- Do not write to `main` while red; do not skip milestone gates.
- Do not implement anything on the R15 post-v1 list **whose phase is not open**.
  Phases 1 (editor), 2 (effects and world content), 3 (the 2D layer and
  navmesh, opened 2026-09-23) and 4 (multiplayer) ARE open. Mobile opened for
  **Android** on 2026-09-26 -- the owner asked for the platformer on his phone
  with touch controls; `scripts/android-player.ps1` -- and iOS is not open.
  **Xbox/UWP** (a Developer Mode player and the optional Xbox provider, ADRs
  0188, 0190, 0191, 0193) and **local co-op** (several players on one machine)
  opened on 2026-10-09 -- the owner tested both and opened them as built.
  **The web** (a game that opens from a link) opened on 2026-10-10 -- the
  owner, approving the nine-category roadmap
  (`docs/briefs/level-up-roadmap.md`, its eighth) and saying so himself: "a
  fase WEB ABERTA". iOS stays closed until he says: it needs his Mac and his
  Apple account, which are his to give.
  Opening one is the owner's decision — taking it for them is what R15 actually
  forbids.
- Do not put a proprietary SDK in the engine. One is allowed only as an
  **optional provider module outside the core** (ADR 0188): never a dependency
  of the engine itself, never under `third_party/`, off by default, and never
  redistributing the vendor's files -- the module finds them in the
  developer's own installation.

## Map

`docs/architecture.md` (native core) · `docs/api-design.md` (Luau API/DX) ·
`docs/roadmap.md` (M0 through M8, plus M4.5 and M7.5, with gates) ·
`docs/decisions/` (ADRs 0001–0108; `README.md` indexes them) ·
`docs/research/` (frozen reports + UNCONFIRMED registry) · `PROGRESS.md`
(ledger) · `docs/briefs/` (per-milestone kickoffs).

Each closed milestone's brief carries a **Findings** section — the things the
docs assumed that reality corrected. Read the current and previous milestone's
before starting work; they exist so the same discovery is not paid for twice.
