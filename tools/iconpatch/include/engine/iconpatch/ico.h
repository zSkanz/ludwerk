// The two byte layouts an icon lives in, and the conversion between them.

// **Split out of `main.cpp` so it can be tested** (S7.10). Everything else in
// this tool is `UpdateResourceW` and `LoadLibraryExW`, which need Windows and a
// real PE; this part is arithmetic over bytes and needs neither. It is also the
// part where being wrong is silent: `main.cpp`'s own comment says an executable
// with an icon-shaped hole in it is what a mistake here produces, and nothing
// fails when an icon is wrong -- the program runs and wears the wrong face.
//
// Built on every platform even though the tool is Windows-only, so the Tier-2
// gate reads it too. A parser is a parser.
