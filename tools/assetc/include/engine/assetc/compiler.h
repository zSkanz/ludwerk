// `assetc` -- the offline asset compiler (roadmap M7, M7 brief Decision 1).
//
// `ludwerk build-assets` is a Luau command that drives this binary. The split is
// where the two halves belong: the Luau side owns the project model -- where
// the content directory is, what is stale, what the console says -- and this
// side owns the codecs, because Lute cannot run a mesh simplifier and a texture
// encoder is a C++ library this repository already vendors.
//
// **Determinism is designed in rather than tested for afterwards**, and it is
// four rules:
//
//   1. Inputs are sorted by relative path before anything is processed. A
//      directory iterator's order is the filesystem's, and it differs between
//      machines.
//   2. Every encoder parameter is pinned in this tool rather than defaulted, so
//      an upstream default change is a diff here instead of a silent rebuild of
//      every asset.
//   3. No timestamps, no absolute paths and no machine names reach the output
//      bytes. A URN uses forward slashes on every host.
//   4. Encoding is single-threaded, because meshoptimizer's format-version
//      setters are process-global and documented as not thread-safe.
//
// The gate is a double build: compile the same tree twice and diff the manifest
// and the pack.
