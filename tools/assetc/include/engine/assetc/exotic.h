// The exotic-format importer: FBX, OBJ, COLLADA, PLY and STL, through assimp.
//
// **Offline only, and structurally so** (ADR 0010). This header lives under
// `tools/`, assimp is linked into `assetc` and into nothing else, and the
// layering gate reads real `#include` edges -- so "the runtime never links an
// importer" is a fact about the build graph rather than a promise in a comment.
// The engine reads `.lmesh`, which is a format assimp has never heard of.
//
// **glTF stays on fastgltf even though assimp can read it.** The runtime
// pipeline's importer and the exotic-format importer are different jobs: one is
// the path every shipped asset takes and was proved at M4, the other is a
// convenience for getting somebody's existing model into the engine once. Two
// importers for one format is two behaviours for one format, and the day they
// disagree is the day nobody can say which is right.
//
// Everything it produces is an `asset::Model` -- the same struct `importGltf`
// fills -- so an FBX and a glTF are indistinguishable by the time the mesh
// compiler sees them. That is the point: the pipeline downstream has one shape
// to handle.
