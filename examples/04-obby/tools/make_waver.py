"""Generates examples/04-obby/content/models/waver.gltf.

Checked in as the .gltf it produces rather than run at build time, for the same
reason `examples/02-meshes/tools/make_scene.py` is: a text glTF diffs line by
line, and a generator in the build would make an example's content depend on
Python. This script lives beside it so the next person can see how the numbers
were arrived at rather than guessing.

**The waver is the obby's skinned-animation demonstrator**: a bar welded 3.4 m
above the character, playing a looping wave, so the animation can be seen riding
the character through every contact. Two joints and five rows of vertices, with
the rows between the ends ramping from one joint to the other.

WHAT CHANGED AT M7.5, and both were reported by a human looking at it:

  * **The bend collapsed the bar into a wedge.** Three rows put a ninety-degree
    rotation across a single fifty-fifty vertex row, and linear blend skinning
    pinches wherever a large rotation crosses a blended vertex -- the "candy
    wrapper". What was left projected as a triangle pointing down. Five rows and
    a forty-degree wave spread the rotation until the blend holds its width.
  * **It was a plane, and a plane has one side.** Six vertices, four triangles,
    every one of them at z = 0. The pipeline culls back faces, so from behind the
    character the waver was not dim or thin -- it was GONE, and from in front the
    bend folded its silhouette into shapes nobody could name. A bar with
    thickness has the same outline from every angle and cannot vanish.
  * **It declared no material at all.** glTF says a primitive without one uses
    the default material, and that default is `metallicFactor` 1.0 with
    `roughnessFactor` 1.0 -- a perfectly rough metal, which renders as a dark
    grey slab. The engine was right and the asset was under-specified. It has a
    material now.

The joints, their inverse binds and the animation's single rotation channel are
M6's. What changed inside them is the vertex rows the weights are spread over and
the size of the rotation -- the rig is the same rig.
