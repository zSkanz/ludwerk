"""Generates examples/02-meshes/content/models/{scene,pane}.gltf.

Checked in as the .gltf it produces rather than run at build time: a text glTF
diffs line by line, and a generator in the build would make the example's own
content depend on Python. This script lives beside it so the next person can see
how the numbers were arrived at rather than guessing.

Two files rather than one, and the reason is a property rather than a picture:
`BasePart.Transparency` is per INSTANCE, so demonstrating a fade needs a second
`MeshPart` for the script to set it on. A fifth node inside `scene.gltf` would be
a fifth section of one part and would carry no per-instance property at all --
which is exactly why M4's deliverable could not have shown the defect.
